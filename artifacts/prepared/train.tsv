54312	0	 <p>Yes, of course there is :-) object oriented techniques are a tool ... if you use the wrong tool for a given job, you will be over complicating things (think spoon when all you need is a knife).</p> <p>To me, I judge "how much" by the size and scope of the project. If it is a small project, sometimes it does add too much complexity. If the project is large, you will still be taking on this complexity, but it will pay for itself in ease of maintainability, extensibility, etc.</p>

8978532	0	NSView subclass over another NSView subclass? <p>I'm trying to create an Cocoa-AppleScript Application with some basic functions, and I want to display a background image for the window and then display a color box above it. </p> <p>I finally figured out how to set the background image via this guide (<a href="http://www.mere-mortal-software.com/blog/details.php?d=2007-01-08" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.mere-mortal-software.com/blog/details.php?d=2007-01-08</a>), but I don't know how to set a color box above it. The basic layout I'm trying to achieve is this:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o25EI.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>The window view has a class of <code>ViewBackground</code> which is a subclass of <code>NSView</code>. The <code>ViewBackground.m</code> file looks like this:</p> <pre><code>-(void)drawRect:(NSRect)rect { NSImage *anImage = [NSImage imageNamed:@"repeat"]; [[NSColor colorWithPatternImage:anImage] set]; NSRectFill([self bounds]); } </code></pre> <p>Like I said, that works fine. The problem is when I try to put the box with the background color white above it. I thought I would be able to do this by making a new subclass of <code>NSView</code>, <code>ContentBackground</code>. The <code>ContentBackground.m</code> file looks like this:</p> <pre><code>-(void)drawRect:(NSRect)rect { [[NSColor whiteColor] set]; NSRectFill(rect); } </code></pre> <p>The hierarchy of my windows looks like this:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PzF0I.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>Now this <em>sometimes</em> works, but usually produces this result in the debugger:</p> <pre><code>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadAppleScriptObjectiveCScripts]; return NSApplicationMain(argc, (const char **)argv); Thread 1: Stopped at breakpoint 1 } </code></pre> <p>What am I doing wrong and how can I fix this?</p> <p>Also, the content (buttons, etc..) will go on top of the <code>ContentBackground</code> box.</p>

Probably it cannot find some required resources.</p> <p>Reading some code and some webdites, i think that probably you are just lacking the url option of the viewhelper, so ElFinder can find the backend route he tries to connect to. </p> <p>With the QuElFinder, the route to the connector is <code>/quelfinder/connector</code> so in your view, the code will be:</p> <pre><code>echo $this-&gt;QuElFinder('elfinder', array( 'width' =&gt; "50%", 'height' =&gt; '300', 'url' =&gt; '/quelfinder/connector' ) ); </code></pre> <p>Also, you should go to <code>QuElFinder/config/module.config.php</code> and check everything under </p> <pre><code> 'QuConfig'=&gt;array( 'QuElFinder'=&gt;array( </code></pre> <p>because as you can see in the QuElFinder controller, in the <code>connectorAction()</code> function, it is reading that configuration, and there is a lot of paths.</p>

30134561	0	 <p>This is one of those cases where type signatures really help. Stare for a second at the type signature: </p> <pre><code>(+=) :: (ArrowXml a) =&gt; a b XmlTree -&gt; a b XmlTree -&gt; a b XmlTree </code></pre> <p>First off, <code>ArrowXml</code> is a subclass of <code>Arrow</code>, which describes some sort of machinery taking some input to some output. You can think of it like a big factory with conveyor belts taking things to different machines, and we're building these factory machines and hence factories with functions. Three of the Arrow combinators, for example, are:</p> <pre><code>(&amp;&amp;&amp;) :: (Arrow a) =&gt; a b c -&gt; a b c' -&gt; a b (c, c') |infixr 3| Fanout: send the input to both argument arrows and combine their output. arr :: (Arrow a) =&gt; (b -&gt; c) -&gt; a b c Lift a function to an arrow. (.) :: (Category cat) =&gt; cat b c -&gt; cat a b -&gt; cat a c morphism composition. </code></pre> <p>Now look at the lowercase letter (type variable) very closely in:</p> <pre><code>(+=) :: (ArrowXml a) =&gt; a b XmlTree -&gt; a b XmlTree -&gt; a b XmlTree </code></pre> <p>Clearly we're taking two machines which turn <code>b</code>s into <code>XmlTree</code>s and "merging them together" into one machine which takes a <code>b</code> in and expels an <code>XmlTree</code>. But importantly, this type signature tells us that more or less the <strong>only</strong> way that this can be implemented is:</p> <pre><code>arr1 += arr2 = arr f . (arr1 &amp;&amp;&amp; arr2) where f :: (XmlTree, XmlTree) -&gt; XmlTree f = _ </code></pre> <p>This is because of "free theorems"; if you don't know the type of a parameter then we can prove that you can't really <em>do</em> much with it. (It can be a little more complicated because the arrow might have structures which aren't totally encapsulated by <code>arr</code>, like internal counters which are summed together with <code>.</code> which are then set to <code>0</code> when using <code>arr</code>. So actually replace <code>arr f</code> with a generic <code>a (XmlTree, XmlTree) XmlTree</code> and you're good to go.)</p> <p>So we must have <strong>parallel execution</strong> of the two arrows here. That's what I'm trying to say. Because the combinator <code>(+=)</code> doesn't know what <code>b</code> is, it has no choice but to blithely feed the <code>b</code> to the arrows in parallel and then try to combine their outputs together. So, <code>deep (hasName "bar")</code> does not look at <code>foo</code>.</p> <p>You can possibly make a mutually recursive solution with <code>deep (hasName "bar") . foo</code> if you really want, but it seems potentially dangerous (i.e. infinite loop), so it may be safer to simply define something like:</p> <pre><code>a ++= b = a += (b . a) </code></pre> <p>where the "current" a is "fed" to b to produce the update. To do this you will have to import <code>.</code> from <code>Control.Category</code> as it is not the same as <code>Prelude..</code> (which does function composition only). This looks like:</p> <pre><code>import Prelude hiding ((.)) import Control.Category ((.)) </code></pre>

You can apply your custom <em>large sobel filter</em> with <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/imgproc/imgtrans/filter_2d/filter_2d.html" rel="nofollow">filter2d</a>, and then code the Canny non maxima suppression.</p> <p>However, Sobel with mask larger then 3x3 is rarely used in practice.</p>

19128203	0	 <p>JayData does <strong>NOT</strong> track complex types (like arrays or custom type objects) inner values.. It just tracks the reference to the value.</p> <p>In case you want to force the update in this case, you have to make a "deep copy" or encapsulate you current object into another one for the reference to change. For example using jQuery:</p> <pre><code>entity.field = jQuery.extend({}, field); </code></pre> <p>Nothing really changes for your object values, but it gets encapsulated in jQuery's object and the reference has changed, so JayData thinks it's value has changed and sends the updated values to the server.</p> <p>It is a workaround, but as my friend said: "Do you really care about how much <strong><em>clients'</em></strong> CPU you use?" :)</p>

3379561	0	Integrate an E-Mail server into ASP.NET <p>I've a general design question:<br /> <br /> I have a mailserver, written in C#.<br /> Then I have a web forum software, written in for ASP.NET in C#.<br /> <br /> Now I'd like to integrate the mailserver into the ASP.NET forum application. For example, I'd like to make it possible that one can create a mailinglist from the forum, and give users the oportunity to add oneselfs to the mailinglist members in the forum, and then add the new list-members to the respective mailinglist on the server.</p> <p>Since the server is a separate console/winforms/service application, I first thought I'd best use .NET remoting for this.</p> <p>But my second thought was, that some users might host their forum on a host where <br /> (a) they don't have a virtual machine where they can do what they want<br /> (b) the admin of the host might not want to install an additional mailserver or charge extra for this<br /> (c) the user might have a service plan that only permits to add a web-application, not external programs (very likely)<br /> <br /><br /> Now, I wanted to ask:<br /> Is it possible to fully integrate a mailserver into an ASP.NET application somehow ? (I have the full source of the server + ASP.NET application)</p> <p>Well, it probably won't be a page or a ashx handler, but something like a http module ? Or what's the general way to integrate TCP/IP applications into asp.net ?

6267788	0	Making pre- and post-build event scripts pretty? <p>I have some moderately hefty pre- and post-build event scripts for my Visual Studio 2008 projects (actually it's mainly post-build event scripts). They work OK in that they function correctly and when I <code>exit 0</code> the build succeeds and when I <code>exit 1</code> the build fails with an error. However, that error is enormous, and goes something like this:</p> <pre><code>The command "if Release == Debug goto Foo if Release == Release goto Bar exit 0 :Foo mkdir "abc" copy "$(TargetDir)file.dll" "abc" [...] " exited with code 1. </code></pre> <p>You get the idea. The entire script is always dumped out as part of the error description. The entire script is also dumped out in the Output window while the build is happening, too. So, why have I seen various references on the web to using <code>echo</code> in these scripts? For example, here's part of an example on one particular site:</p> <pre><code>:BuildEventFailed echo POSTBUILDSTEP for $(ProjectName) FAILED exit 1 :BuildEventOK echo POSTBUILDSTEP for $(ProjectName) COMPLETED OK </code></pre> <p>Is there a way to get Visual Studio to suppress all script output apart from what is <code>echo</code>ed (and therefore using <code>echo</code> only to output what you want would make sense), or are these examples just misguided and they don't realize that the whole script is always dumped out?</p>

This means your assignments at the end for the tempState, currState and nextState cannot work (as you have discovered).</p> <p>After declaring space for the 2 2d-arrays, you could then declare pointers to the 2d arrays which you might be able to work in a reasonable way. To use the pointers for indexing into the 2-d array, the compiler would need to be aware of the size of the last dimension(s) of the array.</p>

40985875	0	Getters, Setters and Constructors in Java - Making a car and stocking it <p>I'm trying to create a class in Java using BlueJ. My class is named Automobile. My goal is to be able to use my Constructor method to create cars with the variables: year, color, brand, number of doors, number of kilometers, if it's automatic (boolean), if it's sold (boolean), a description, and an identification number. All the variables have a set default value, a minimum and a maximum accepted value.</p> <p>I have to use getVariablename and setVariablename for my methods. My color and brand variables are int, and I made methods to retrieve their String counterparts in a table in my class. </p> <p>My issue is I don't understand the principle of setting my variable in one method and getting it in another (while making sure it's an accepted value). Also, once I have my Setter and Getter method, what do I have to write down in the creation of my Constructor method?</p> <p>Up to now, I have this :</p> <pre><code>public class Automobile { private static final String[] COLORS = { "Other", "Noir", "Blanc", "Bleu Nuit", "Bleu Clair", "Vert Pomme", "Vert Bouteille", "Taupe", "Argent", "Sable"}; private static final String[] BRANDS = { "Autre", "Mazda", "Toyota", "Ford", "GM", "Hyunday", "BMW", "SAAB", "Honda"}; public static final int COLOR_DEF = 8; public static final int COLOR_MIN = 0; public static final int COLOR_MAX = COULEURS.length - 1; public static final int BRAND_DEF = 4; public static final int BRAND_MIN = 0; public static final int BRAND_MAX = MARQUES.length - 1; public static final double KILO_DEFAULT = 55000; public static final double KILO_MIN = 15000; public static final double KILO_MAX = 140000; public static final int TWO_DOORS = 2; public static final int FOUR_DOORS = 4; public static final int DOORS_DEFAULT = FOUR_DOORS; public static final boolean AUTO_DEF = true; public static final int YEAR_MIN = 1997; public static final int YEAR_MAX = 2016; public static final int YEAR_DEFAUT = 2007; public static final String COMM_DEFAUT = ""; public static String color (int cou) { String chainecolor = ""; if (cou &gt;= COLOR_MIN &amp;&amp; cou &lt;= COLOR_MAX) { chainecolor = COLORS[cou]; } return chainecolor; } //This method is to return the String value of a color from its int value using the COLORS table. If invalid it returns an empty chain. public static String brand (int br) { String chainebrand = ""; if (ma &gt;= BRAND_MIN &amp;&amp; ma &lt;= BRAND_MAX) { chainebrand = BRANDS[br]; } return chainebrand; } //same thing for the brand public Automobile (int brand, int year, int color, boolean automatic, double kilometers,int nbrDoors, String description, boolean sold){ //To be completed } //here i'm supposed to create getters that return int values for everything but automatic, sold and description public void setYear ( int year ) { if (year &gt;= YEAR_MIN &amp;&amp; YEAR &lt;= YEAR_MAX) { year = year; } } // supposed to be the setter for my year, as long as it's within the accepted values public void setMarque (int brand){ if (brand &gt;= BRAND_MIN &amp;&amp; brand &lt;= BRAND_MAX) { brand = brand; } } //same, for the brand public void setColor (int color) { if (color &gt;= COLOR_MIN &amp;&amp; color &lt;= COLOR_MAX){ color = color; } }// same for the color public void setNbrDoors (int p) { if (p == TWO_DOORS || p == FOUR_DOORS){ p = p; } } // same for the door. I am forced to use (int p) as the variable for this method, which confuses me as to how I will refer to it from nbrDoors up in the Automobile constructor method } // Automobile </code></pre> <p>So my difficulties lie in: </p> <ul> <li><p>Are the examples of setters that I made valid for this purpose? I do not understand the need for p = p, or color = color...</p></li> <li><p>How do I create a getter method that will be able to go pick up the Variable p from setNbrDoors, return its value and have it be used for nbrDoors in the Automobile constructor?</p></li> <li><p>What am I supposed to write in the Constructor method, such as it will be able to get its values from the getters?</p></li> </ul> <p>This is all because the second part is I will have to create a little code to ask the user to input all the values for variables, then create a table to stock the Cars the user creates.</p> <p>P.S.: the work is originally in french, so I translated the variable and method names best I could for your better understanding. Also, the variable names, methods, etc are all imposed, I am FORCED to make the class this way exactly.</p> <p>EDIT: As such, the use of static for brand and color conversion are also imposed. Those 2 methods are solely for returning a String of character from an int value. they are not used in the Constructor. Finally, the exceptions will be handled in the second part of the work using a separate validation loop. The Automobile class is really used solely to handle the creation of the "car" object.</p>

Neo4j-OGM only supports </p> <blockquote> <p>any primitive, boxed primitive or String or arrays thereof, essentially anything that naturally fits into a Neo4j node property. </p> </blockquote> <p>If you want to work around that, you may need to create a custom type convertor. For example, </p> <pre><code>import org.neo4j.ogm.typeconversion.AttributeConverter class XYZ{ XYZ(Integer x, String y) { this.x = x this.y = y } Integer x String y } public class XYZConverter implements AttributeConverter&lt;XYZ, String&gt; { @Override public String toGraphProperty(XYZ value) { return value.x.toString() + "!@#" + value.y } @Override public XYZ toEntityAttribute(String value) { String[] split = value.split("!@#") return new XYZ(Integer.valueOf(split[0]), split[1]) } } </code></pre> <p>You can then annotate the @NodeEntity with a @Convert like this</p> <pre><code>@NodeEntity class Node { @GraphId Long id; @Property String name @Convert(value = XYZConverter.class) XYZ xyz } </code></pre> <p>On the flip side, its not a good practice to do this, since ideally you should link Node and XYZ with a 'hasA' relationship.

22110067	0	 <p>If you select only HEAD, than any changes in any revisions prior to HEAD will not be included in the merge. You either need to select ALL the revisions in the branch whose changes are not yet included in your branch, or leave the range specifier empty to allow SVN to figure out which revisions to merge.</p> <p><strong>Edited to add example</strong></p> <p>When you do a "range of revisions" merge, you are picking individual CHANGES to cherry-pick over into your merge destination. If you say "merge HEAD" you are not saying "merge all changes up through HEAD", you are saying "merge only the specific change that happened in the very last revision on that branch". Consider a trunk with revision 122; a MayBranch with revisions 123, 124, and 125; and an AugustBranch with revisions 126 and 127. Both branches were copied from trunk revision 122.</p> <p>You want all three changes on the MayBranch&ndash;123, 124, and 125&ndash;to be merged into your AugustBranch. If you select all three revisions, or leave the revision specifier empty, this will happen. The merge will use revision 122 on trunk as the BASE, with 125 on MayBranch as source revision, and 127 on AugustBranch as destination revision.</p> <p>If instead you select HEAD as the revision to merge, SVN will use revision 124 on MayBranch as the BASE, with 125 as the source revision and 127 as destination as before. Since BASE is now the place where revision 125's changes were started from, you only get the changes that specifically happened in revision 125.</p> <p>The final result is as if you had exported only revision 125 on MayBranch as a diff, and then applied that diff to the AugustBranch. Except this is done with merge tracking information included so that SVN knows how to get the whole branch automatically later if you like.</p>

2077746	0	 <p>Most of the answers here I don't think are really going to wow anyone, especially a tech crowd. They might be surprised that Perl can do it, but they aren't going to be surprised that you can do the task. However, even if they aren't surprised that you can do it, they might be surprised how fast, or with how little code, you can do it.</p> <p>If you're looking for things to show them that will wow them, you have to figure out what they think is hard in their jobs and see if Perl could make it really easy. I find that people tend not to care if a language can do something they don't already have an interest in. That being said, impressing anyone with Perl is the same as impressing anyone in any other subject of field: you have to know them and what they will be impressed by. You have to know your audience.</p> <p>Perl doesn't really have any special features that allow it to do any one thing that some other language can also do. However, Perl combines a lot of features that you usually don't find in the same programming language.</p> <p>Most of the things that I'm impressed by have almost nothing to do with the language:</p> <ul> <li><p>There's a single codebase that runs on a couple hundred different platforms, despite differences in architecture.</p></li> <li><p>Perl's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CPAN</a> is still unrivaled among other languages (which is really sad because it's so easy to do the same thing for other languages).</p></li> <li><p>The testing culture has really raised the bar in Perl programming, and there's a lot of work that teases out platform dependencies, cross-module issues, and so on without the original developer having to do much.</p></li> </ul>

If you are restricted to a particular range of ports, then you'll need to do local address and port binding. However, in that case, since each process is only handling a single connection, I would just assign each process a unique port when it is started, rather than having it try to find an available one.</p> <p>That is, assuming there is a single process responsible for starting all the other processes, that single process would decide which port should be used by the process it is about the start. This is simpler because the decision is made by a single entity, so it can use a simple algorithm, like:</p> <pre><code>for (unsigned short p = minPort; p &lt; maxPort; ++p) { child_pid = startWorker(p); child_pid_map[child_pid] = p; } </code></pre> <p>If the child dies, the starter process can consult the <code>child_pid_map</code> to reuse that port immediately.</p> <p>If using an external agent to assign ports is not possible, the simplest technique is to just attempt a <code>bind</code> call to a random port in the range. If it fails with <code>EADDRINUSE</code>, then incrementally try the next port number in the sequence (wrapping if necessary) until success is achieved, or you have tried all the ports.</p>

22248851	0	 <h1>Bulk Binds (BULK COLLECT &amp; FORALL) and Record Processing in Oracle</h1> <p>Although this topic involves a much larger discussion of how to optimize database DML operations for large record sets, this approach is applicable for variable magnitudes of record volumes and even has a nice feature set, which includes a DML option called <strong>SAVE EXCEPTIONS</strong>, which enables a database operation to SKIP and continue past individual DML transactions that have encountered EXCEPTIONS.</p> <p>I have adapted a script and added some additional explanatory notation to show how this works. If you would like some additional reading from the source I used, see the following link for a discussion on <a href="http://www.oracle-base.com/articles/9i/bulk-binds-and-record-processing-9i.php#save_exceptions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Oracle DML Bulk Binds and Record Processing</a>.</p> <h2>The Sample Table: exception_test</h2> <p>Use the DDL Below to create the test table used to store the data from our procedure's Bulk Binding DML commands:</p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE "EXCEPTION_TEST" ( "ID" NUMBER(15,0) NOT NULL ENABLE, CONSTRAINT "EXCEPTION_TEST_PK" PRIMARY KEY ("ID") ENABLE ) / </code></pre> <p>The Primary Key is the single column.

I recommend at least using ORDER BY clauses carefully and consistently in your DML cursors so that your loop iterations are consistently matched with the same index/key values.</p></li> <li><p>There are some additional extensions to the functionality of the SAVE EXCEPTIONS and BULK DML handling alternatives that may prove to serve additional utility above traditional approaches to large volume DML operations. Among them includes: error threshold limitations (i.e., quit when a pre-defined number of DML exceptions are handled) and Bulk Processing loop size definitions. </p></li> </ol>

You mentioned 'columns' so it sounds like you have header's of A, B, and C and they want to see a totals. You can generally add a grouping but then have it collapse or expand on demand. That way you present an end user with the data but they have the option of expanding it to see more if they want.</p> <p>Since you did not specify if you have a matrix I will assume you have one. When you have multiple categories you can hit the grouping of a row or column and if you are having a matrix it is probably using a [SUM(field)]. The grouping of columns are showing all of them, however you can specify they are collapsed or expanded at runtime. Right Click the grouing and you get 'Group Properties'. Select the 'Visibility' pane on the left. Choose 'Hide' radio button and the default for your report will 'collapse' the values to be an aggregate instead of the expanded details of each column. If you want an option to have the user expand or collapse select the checkbox 'Display can be toggled by this report item:'. Choose a textbox or other object outside the collected scope and a user can be presented with the option to collapse or expand on default.</p>

They are hidden (nested) and can be found, after making a second getJSON (line 8 in the function), using the individual "id" of each object. Now Facebook replies:</p> <pre><code>{ "description": "http://www.eventim.de/koerner\nTickets ab sofort exklusiv auf eventim.de und ab MI 07.09. \u00fcberall wo es Tickets gibt sowie auf contrapromotion.com.", "end_time": "2017-03-16T23:00:00+0100", "is_date_only": false, "location": "Yuca K\u00f6ln", "name": "K\u00f6rner // G\u00e4nsehaut Tour 2017 // K\u00f6ln", "owner": { "name": "K\u00f6rner", "category": "Musician/Band", "id": "366592010215263" }, "privacy": "OPEN", "start_time": "2017-03-16T20:00:00+0100", "timezone": "Europe/Berlin", "updated_time": "2016-09-28T10:31:47+0000", "venue": { "name": "Yuca K\u00f6ln" }, "id": "985939951529300" } </code></pre> <p>Et voila, the details I was looking for. After making this second (nested) AJAX call, I push the JSON data in the array "events" (line 12). </p> <p><strong>The Problem</strong></p> <p>This should fill up the array with every .each iteration. However, take a look at the two 'console.logs'. The first one returns the filled array, the second one returns an empty array... If the AJAX calls are being made synchronously (which is not how it is supposed to be), e.g. by adding <code>$.ajaxSetup({async: false});</code> prior to the function, it works fine however. The array is filled and can be rendered (line 18).</p> <p><strong>The Question</strong> </p> <p>How can this behaviour be explained and how can this function be done right? I know, there must be a way using deferred and promises? I thought i did, by using .when.then.done... obviously I erred.</p> <p>With best regards, Julius</p>

So, I need to check that anyone of these 3 fields is in common.</p> <p>For example:</p> <ul> <li>User ID: 1; IP: 1.1.1.1; Email: test@test.com </li> <li>User ID: 2; IP: 1.1.1.1; Email: test2@test.com </li> <li>User ID: 1; IP: 1.1.1.2; Email: test3@test.com</li> <li>User ID: 4; IP: 1.1.1.4; Email: test@test.com</li> <li>User ID: 5; IP: 1.1.1.4; Email: test5@test.com</li> </ul> <p>All of these would match as the SAME user because they share EITHER the user ID, the IP or the email. Then I need to output all user IDs, IPs and emails so I can ban any user in another table that matches these criteria. </p>

33835975	0	Does provisioning have a place in the Drupal world? <p>My team is relatively new to Drupal. One thing we have struggled to understand is how to work with it from a DevOps point of view. I realize this is too large a subject for one question so I have a more specific question that gets at the heart of the matter.</p> <p>How does one provision a Drupal instance? By "provision", I mean create a provisioning script that builds my CMS (we're only using Drupal for that purpose) starting with a clean virtual machine with only OS and web server. The script would install and configure Drupal and its modules and connect to an existing database containing my content. Or perhaps I can even have it add my content to Drupal instance with an empty database. I'm just not sure what makes sense.</p> <p>What I am trying to avoid is the uncertainty and non-reproducability that comes with doing everything interactively via Drupal's UI. I realize that Drupal has lots of techniques for exporting various things but there doesn't appear to be any coherent overall picture. Every bit of advice is of the form, "If you want to do (some specific thing), this is how you might do it." Or, even worse, "This worked for me." Neither of these things gives me much confidence or, more importantly, gives decent "best practices" advice that tells us what Drupal's designers intended.</p> <p>There are some Drupal "best practices" articles but they don't go much beyond advice such as, "Do a backup before changing anything." I need more useful advice.</p>

You would change remote.LibraryB.url to point to your local version, and your local version would be clone of original LibraryB. Note that you should merge your own branch, and not remote-tracking branch of canonical LibraryB.</p> <p>The disadvantage is that you have to maintain separate clone, and to remember that your own changes (well, at least those generic) to LibraryB have to be made in the fork of LibraryB, and not directly inside ProjectA.</p></li> <li><p>You might want to move from 'subtree' merge which interweaves history of ProjectA and LibraryB, to having more separation that can be achieved using <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="git-submodule(1)">submodule</a> (<a href="http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitSubmoduleTutorial" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Git Submodule Tutorial at Git wiki">tutorial</a>). In this case you would have separate repository (fork) of LibraryB, but it would be inside working area of ProjectA; the commit in ProjectA would have instead of having tree of LibraryB as subtree, pointer to commit in LibraryB repository. Then if you do not want to follow LibraryB development, it would be enough to simply not use 'git submodule update' (and perhaps just in case comment out or remove link to canonical version of LibraryB).</p> <p>This has the advantage of making it easy to send your improvements to canonical LibraryB, and the advantage that you make changes inside working area of ProjectA. It has disadvantage of having to learn slightly different workflow.</p> <p>Additionally there is also an issue of how to go from 'subtree' merge to submodules. You can either:</p> <ul> <li>Move from subtree merge to submodule by creating git repository in the subproject subtree in superproject working repository (i.e. "git init" inside appropriate subdirectory + appropriate "git submodule init" etc.). This means that you would have 'subtree' up to some point of history, and submodule later.</li> <li>Rewrite history using <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="git-filter-branch(1)">git filter-branch</a> to replace subtree merge by submodule. This has the disadvantage of rewriting history (big no if somebody based his/her work on current history), and advantage of 'clean start'. Or you can wait a bit for "git submodule split" (<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/109667" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="[RFC] What&#39;s the best UI for &#39;git submodule split&#39;?">thread on git mailing list</a>) to make it into git...<br> <em>Unfortunately <a href="http://www.ishlif.org/blog/linux/splitting-a-git-repository/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Splitting a git repository</a> blog posts returns "host not found"</em></li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>I hope that this version solve your problem.</p> <p><strong><em>Disclaimer:</em></strong> <em>I have used neither subtree merge, nor submodules, nor git-filter-branch personally.</em></p>

40963998	0	 <p>The header file (<code>.h</code>) is the programmer's interface to your module. Anything a user (programmer) of your module needs to know to use your module should be in there, but put the actual implementations in the associated <code>.c</code> file. Generally, you put the function prototypes (e.g. <code>int f(void);</code>) in the <code>.h</code> file and the definitions (the implementations, e.g. <code>int f(void) { return 1; }</code>) in the <code>.c</code> file. The linker matches the prototype to the definition because the function signatures match (the name, argument types, and return type). One way to think about it is the <code>.h</code> file as what you share with everyone, and the <code>.c</code> file as what you keep to yourself.</p> <p>If you want a user of your module to have access to <code>STUDENT_SIZE</code>, then put</p> <pre><code>#define STUDENT_SIZE 20 </code></pre> <p>in your <code>.h</code> file instead of your <code>.c</code> file. Then, any file with</p> <pre><code>#include "stud.h" </code></pre> <p>would have your macro for <code>STUDENT_SIZE</code>. (Notice the file name is <code>"stud.h"</code> not <code>"stud"</code>.)</p> <blockquote> <p>Lets say i want to use STUDENT_SIZE in another file whats the syntax? Do i need to use stud.STUDENT_SIZE?</p> </blockquote> <p>No. You might be confusing this with namespaces, which <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4396140/why-doesnt-ansi-c-have-namespaces">C does not have</a> in the same sense as other languages like C++, Java, etc. Just use <code>STUDENT_SIZE</code>. (This is why it is important to not use existing identifiers, and also why many people frown upon macros.)</p> <blockquote> <p>... i want from another file to access some of the functions inside stud.c.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you want another file to have access to some function in <code>stud.c</code>, then put that function's prototype in <code>stud.h</code>. This is precisely what the header file is for.</p> <blockquote> <p>... if i want to lets say make an array of students:</p> <p><code>struct stud students[STUDENT_SIZE];</code></p> <p>Can i access that normally like <code>students[5].stud_id</code> ?</p> </blockquote> <p>As you have written your header file, no. You might know some <code>struct stud</code> exists, but you don't know what the members are called (i.e. you wouldn't know <code>stud_id</code> exists). The reason is that the user of your module sees only what is in the header file, and you defined no members of the struct in your header file. (I'm surprised what you have written even compiles, because you define <code>struct stud</code> twice, once empty <code>{}</code>, and once with members.) Again, if you want the programmer user to have access to the members of <code>struct stud</code>, its definition</p> <pre><code>struct stud { char stud_id[MAX_STR_LEN]; char stud_name[MAX_STR_LEN]; struct grade Grade[MAX_STRUCT]; struct income Income[MAX_STRUCT]; }; </code></pre> <p>belongs in your header file (along with whatever those other macros are). Without knowing this, the programmer (and the compiler) has no idea what the members of <code>struct stud</code> are.</p> <p>(You didn't ask about this, but if you want to share access to a <em>global variable</em> in your <code>.c</code> file, then <em>declare</em> it with the keyword <code>extern</code> in your <code>.h</code> file, and without <code>extern</code> in your <code>.c</code> file. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/496448/how-to-correctly-use-the-extern-keyword-in-c">How to correctly use the extern keyword in C</a> for more.)</p>

I know there is a variables tab but I would like to use print because of its ability to print out function calls and such.

18151185	0	 <p>The <em>technical</em> difference is the presence of <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> accessors. You can customize either or both to do more that just get or set the value.</p> <p>The <em>practical</em> difference is that many data-binding methods (including most if not all of the .NET controls) use reflection to bind to <em>properties</em> only - they do not support binding to <em>fields</em> directly.</p> <p>If you plan to bind the properties of your class to a UI control (<code>DataGrid</code>, <code>TextBox</code>, etc.), or if there's the <em>slightest</em> chance that you might customize the get/set accessors in the future, then make the properties. It is a breaking change to change a field to a property.</p> <p>Many coding standards (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182141.aspx" rel="nofollow">including FxCop</a>) hold that you should use properties instead of fields for public data.</p> <p>If lines of code are a concern you can use auto-implemented properties:</p> <pre><code>class Class2 { public static int A {get; set; } } </code></pre> <p>You can later add logic to the get/set accessors without breaking users of your class.</p>
29919674	0	How to use dependent bundles in different container in Fabri8? <p>I am trying to understand the capabilities of Fabric8's container management. I just want to clarify weather the following scenario can be achieved by using Fabric8 in JBossFuse.</p> <p>I have created simple 2 bundles (tick, tock bundles inspired by the : <a href="http://kevinboone.net/osgitest.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://kevinboone.net/osgitest.html</a>). Simply Tick bundle is exporting a package and Tock bundle is importing it. In another words, Tock Bundle depends on the Tick Bundle.</p> <p>These 2 bundles are working perfectly when deployed in a single container (say in a one child container in JBoossFuse).</p> <p>Then I have created a cluster by using the fabric8 and added its containers to the Fabric Ensemble as well.</p> <p>And I have created 2 profiles. TickProfile contains the Tick bundle and Tock profile contains the Tock bundle.</p> <p>I have deployed above 2 profiles in 2 different containers as follows, </p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yiZjK.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>Then it is not working properly because Tock bundle cannot resolve its dependency of Tick Bundle which is exposed by Tick Bundle (because those bundles are in two different containers).</p> <p>I thought this is possible with fabric8 but it seems it cannot.</p> <p>It would be really appreciated if someone can tell me whether there is any way of achieving this.</p> <p>Thanks.</p>

5232342	0	 <p>The rate at which the capacity of a vector grows is implementation dependent. Implementations almost invariable choose exponential growth, in order to meet the <em>amortized constant time</em> requirement for the <code>push_back</code> operation. What <em>amortized constant time</em> means and how exponential growth achieves this is interesting.</p> <p>Every time a vector's capacity is grown the elements need to be copied. If you 'amortize' this cost out over the lifetime of the vector, it turns out that if you increase the capacity by an exponential factor you end up with an amortized constant cost.</p> <p>This probably seems a bit odd, so let me explain to you how this works...</p> <ul> <li>size: 1 capacity 1 - No elements have been copied, the cost per element for copies is 0.</li> <li>size: 2 capacity 2 - When the vector's capacity was increased to 2, the first element had to be copied. Average copies per element is 0.5</li> <li>size: 3 capacity 4 - When the vector's capacity was increased to 4, the first two elements had to be copied. Average copies per element is (2 + 1 + 0) / 3 = 1.</li> <li>size: 4 capacity 4 - Average copies per element is (2 + 1 + 0 + 0) / 4 = 3 / 4 = 0.75.</li> <li>size: 5 capacity 8 - Average copies per element is (3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0) / 5 = 7 / 5 = 1.4</li> <li>...</li> <li>size: 8 capacity 8 - Average copies per element is (3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0) / 8 = 7 / 8 = 0.875</li> <li>size: 9 capacity 16 - Average copies per element is (4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0) / 9 = 15 / 9 = 1.67</li> <li>...</li> <li>size 16 capacity 16 - Average copies per element is 15 / 16 = 0.938</li> <li>size 17 capacity 32 - Average copies per element is 31 / 17 = 1.82</li> </ul> <p>As you can see, every time the capacity jumps, the number of copies goes up by the previous size of the array. But because the array has to double in size before the capacity jumps again, the number of copies per element always stays less than 2.</p> <p>If you increased the capacity by 1.5 * N instead of by 2 * N, you would end up with a very similar effect, except the upper bound on the copies per element would be higher (I think it would be 3).</p> <p>I suspect an implementation would choose 1.5 over 2 both to save a bit of space, but also because 1.5 is closer to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">golden ratio</a>. I have an intuition (that is currently not backed up by any hard data) that a growth rate in line with the golden ratio (because of its relationship to the fibonacci sequence) will prove to be the most efficient growth rate for real-world loads in terms of minimizing both extra space used and time.</p>

So I've created a custom UITableViewCell with a Label and UITextField.</p> <p>My ViewController has two arrays. </p> <pre><code>@property (nonatomic, strong) NSArray *items; @property (nonatomic, strong) NSArray *itemValues; </code></pre> <p>My <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> looks something like this...</p> <pre><code>- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath { NSString *cellIdentifier = @"ItemCell"; MyItemTableViewCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:cellIdentifier forIndexPath:indexPath]; if (!cell) { cell = [[MyItemTableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifier:cellIdentifier]; cell.categoryValue.tag = indexPath.row; cell.categoryValue.delegate = self; } cell.item.text = [self.items objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]; cell.itemValue.text = [self.itemValues objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]; return cell; } - (BOOL)textFieldShouldReturn:(UITextField *)textField { NSInteger tag = [textField tag]; NSLog(@"TFSR tag: %zd/%zd", tag, self.categories.count-1); if (tag &lt; (self.categories.count - 1)) { NSIndexPath *nextIndex = [NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:tag+1 inSection:0]; NSLog(@"TFSR nextRow: %zd/%zd\n", nextIndex.row); FFFCategoryTableViewCell *cell = (MyItemTableViewCell *)[self.tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:nextIndex]; [self.tableView scrollToRowAtIndexPath:nextIndex atScrollPosition:UITableViewScrollPositionMiddle animated:YES]; [cell.categoryValue becomeFirstResponder]; } else { NSLog(@"DONE!"); } return YES; } </code></pre> <p>This is proving to be problematic. The goal is, the user should be able to select the UITextField on the first row, enter a value, and when they hit the 'Next' key on the keyboard, they will be sent to the UITextField on the second row. Then 3rd, 4th,... 27th, 28th.</p> <p>However, let's say I first highlight the UITextField on the Cell with IndexPath.row = 11. If I tap 'Next', this is what my output looks like...</p> <pre><code>======== OUTPUT ======== TFSR tag: 11/27 TFSR nextRow: 12/27 TFSR tag: 12/27 TFSR nextRow: 13/27 TFSR tag: 13/27 TFSR nextRow: 14/27 TFSR tag: 0/27 TFSR nextRow: 1/27 </code></pre> <p>Now I fully understand why this is happening. With UITableView trying to save memory in loading various cells, and with the use of dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier... I only have 14 cells (0-13). Then it loops back to the beginning.</p> <p>My problem is... I don't know a solution to this problem. I want the user to be able to his Next until the 28th UITextField row. </p> <p>Any ideas/solutions on how I could achieve this?</p>

(Did you know you can set the showBusyCursor on a remote object instance?)</p> <p>There is no way to globally intercept the method calls on your remote objects though. You'll need to solve this by either:</p> <ol> <li>create a subclass of RemoteObject that sets some global flag on the result and fault events.</li> <li>write the same result and fault event handling code on each remote object call that sets a global flag.</li> </ol> <p>Option 1 is a bit more advanced but will save you the boilerplate code that option 2 has.</p>
2340952	0	<tbody> glitch in PHP Simple HTML DOM parser <p>I'm using PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser to scrape some data of a webshop (also running XAMPP 1.7.2 with PHP5.3.0), and I'm running into problems with <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> tag. The structure of the table is, essentialy (details aren't really that important):</p> <pre><code>&lt;table&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;!--text here--&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;!--text here--&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; </code></pre> <p>Now, I'm trying to get to the <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> section by using code:</p> <pre><code>$element = $html-&gt;find('tbody',0)-&gt;innertext; </code></pre> <p>It doesn't throw any errors, it just prints nothing out when I try to echo it. I've tested the code on other elements, <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>, even something like <code>&lt;span class="price"&gt;</code> and they all work fine (ofcourse, removing ",0" fails the code). They all give their correct sections. Outertext ditto. But it all fails on <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>.</p> <p>Now, I've skimmed through the Parser, but I'm not sure I can figure it out. I've noticed that <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> isn't even mentioned, but it works fine. <em>shrug</em></p> <p>I guess I could try and do child navigation, but that seems to glitch as well. I've just tried running:</p> <pre><code>$el = $html-&gt;find('table',0); $el2 = $el-&gt;children(2); echo $el2-&gt;outertext; </code></pre> <p>and no dice. Tried replacing <code>children</code> with <code>first_child</code> and 2 with 1, and still no dice. Funny, though, if I try <code>-&gt;find</code> instead of <code>children</code>, it works perfectly.</p> <p>I'm pretty confident I could find a work-around the whole thing, but this behaviour seems odd enough to post here. My curious mind is happy for all the help it can get.</p>

Azure definitely looks compelling, but the fact is I can now utilize Windows and SQL server on Amazon with SLAs in place. Ray Ozzie made it clear that Azure will be changing A LOT based on feedback from the developer community. However, Azure has a lot of potential and we'll be watching it closely.</p> <p>Also, Amazon will be adding load balancing, autoscaling and dashboard features in upcoming updates to the service (see this link: <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/new-features-for-amazon-ec2/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/new-features-for-amazon-ec2/</a>). Never underestimate Amazon as they have a good headstart on Cloud Computing and a big user base helping refine their offerings already. Never underestimate Microsoft either as they have a massive developer community and global reach.</p> <p>Overall I do not think the cloud services of one company are mutually exclusive from one another. The great thing is that we can leverage all of them if we want to.</p> <p>Microsoft should offer up the ability to host Linux based servers in their cloud. That would really turn the world upside down!</p>

22946850	0	Evolutionary Artificial Intelligence in Video Games <p>I had an idea pertaining to the use of Artificial Intelligence on a larger scale then most games. The idea is to train and score agents in a game against players, then the data is sent back to a server where it can be scored for fitness and then added to the pool for evolutionary selection. At that point the new agents would be redistributed to the players to be trained and scored by the players again.</p> <p>I am thinking this would be a good use for possibly a neural network or finite state machine that is evolved in a co-evolutionary manner (AI = predator, Players = prey). What I want to know is: </p> <p>1) Are there any papers or examples of this happening already in games? I haven't been able to find any examples.</p> <p>2) Does it seem like this approach would be any better then the traditional approach to AI in games?</p> <p>I am working on a Tactical Turn-based Strategy and thought that this could add a new dimension to gameplay if I can pull it off.</p>

1329167	0	 <p>When you <code>require 'something'</code> Ruby searches for a file called either <code>something.rb</code> or <code>something.dll/so/bundle</code> depending on your platform.</p> <p>In case it finds a library <code>dll/so/bundle</code> it dynamically loads it and search for a symbol called <code>Init_something</code>.

3395055	0	 <p>To store the history of a page, the most popular and full featured/supported way is using hashchanges. This means that say you go from <code>yoursite/page.html#page1</code> to <code>yoursite/page.html#page2</code> you can track that change, and because we are using hashes it can be picked up by bookmarks and back and forward buttons.</p> <p>You can find a great way to bind to hash changes using the jQuery History project <a href="http://www.balupton.com/projects/jquery-history" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.balupton.com/projects/jquery-history</a></p> <p>There is also a full featured AJAX extension for it, allowing you to easily integrate Ajax requests to your states/hashes to transform your website into a full featured Web 2.0 Application: <a href="http://www.balupton.com/projects/jquery-ajaxy" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.balupton.com/projects/jquery-ajaxy</a></p> <p>They both provide great documentation on their demo pages to explain what is happening and what is going on.</p> <p>Here is an example of using jQuery History (as taken from the demo site):</p> <pre><code>// Bind a handler for ALL hash/state changes $.History.bind(function(state){ // Update the current element to indicate which state we are now on $current.text('Our current state is: ['+state+']'); // Update the page"s title with our current state on the end document.title = document_title + ' | ' + state; }); // Bind a handler for state: apricots $.History.bind('/apricots',function(state){ // Update Menu updateMenu(state); // Show apricots tab, hide the other tabs $tabs.hide(); $apricots.stop(true,true).fadeIn(200); }); </code></pre> <p>And an example of jQuery Ajaxy (as taken from the demo site):</p> <pre><code> 'page': { selector: '.ajaxy-page', matches: /^\/pages\/?/, request: function(){ // Log what is happening window.console.debug('$.Ajaxy.configure.Controllers.page.request', [this,arguments]); // Adjust Menu $menu.children('.active').removeClass('active'); // Hide Content $content.stop(true,true).fadeOut(400); // Return true return true; }, response: function(){ // Prepare var Ajaxy = $.Ajaxy; var data = this.State.Response.data; var state = this.state; // Log what is happening window.console.debug('$.Ajaxy.configure.Controllers.page.response', [this,arguments], data, state); // Adjust Menu $menu.children(':has(a[href*="'+state+'"])').addClass('active').siblings('.active').removeClass('active'); // Show Content var Action = this; $content.html(data.content).fadeIn(400,function(){ Action.documentReady($content); }); // Return true return true; </code></pre> <p>And if you ever want to get the querystring params (so <code>yoursite/page.html#page1?a.b=1&amp;a.c=2</code>) you can just use:</p> <pre><code>$.History.bind(function(state){ var params = state.queryStringToJSON(); // would give you back {a:{b:1,c:2}} } </code></pre> <p>So check out those demo links to see them in action, and for all installation and usage details.</p> <hr> <p>Edit: After seeing your code, this is all you would have to do to use it with jQuery History.</p> <p>Change:</p> <pre><code>$('.tabbed_content .tabs li a').live('click', function (e){ e.preventDefault(); switchTab($(this)); }); </code></pre> <p>To:</p> <pre><code>// Bind a handler for ALL hash/state changes $.History.bind(function(state){ switchTab(state); }); </code></pre> <p>Or if you plan to use jQuery History for other areas too, then we would want to ensure that we only call switchTab for our tabs and not all hashes:</p> <pre><code>// Bind a handler for ALL hash/state changes $.History.bind(function(state){ if ( $('.tabbed_content &gt; .content &gt; li[id='+state+']').length ) switchTab(state); }); </code></pre> <p>We no longer use a onclick event, instead we bind to jQuery History as that will detect the hashchange. This is the most important concept to understand, as for instance if we bookmark the site then go back to it, we never clicked it. So instead we change our clicks to bind to the hashchange. As when we click it, bookmark it, back or forward, the hashchange will always fire :-)</p>

First the client calls <code>getdata</code> to retrieve the data from the db, and the server will respond with a temporary <code>{key}</code> that represents the returned dataframe object on the server, for example <code>x01234567</code>.</p> <p>Then you can use this key to either download the dataset or use it as an argument to create the plot. To download the data, simply create a hyperlink to for example:</p> <ul> <li><code>http://your.server.com/ocpu/tmp/x01234567/R/.val/csv</code></li> <li><code>http://your.server.com/ocpu/tmp/x01234567/R/.val/tab</code></li> <li><code>http://your.server.com/ocpu/tmp/x01234567/R/.val/json</code></li> </ul> <p>To create the plot, the client calls <code>makeplot</code> and passes <code>x01234567</code> as the argument value for the data frame. The <code>OpenCPU</code> server will automatically lookup the object for this key to the dataframe object that was returned before by <code>getdata</code>.</p>

4787264	0	 <p>I can't speak for all RDBMS systems, but Postgres specifically uses estimated table sizes as part of its efforts to construct query plans. As an example, if a table has two rows, it may choose a sequential table scan for the portion of the JOIN that uses that table, whereas if it has 10000+ rows, it may choose to use an index or hash scan (if either of those are available.) Incidentally, it used to be possible to trigger poor query plans in Postgres by joining VIEWs instead of actual tables, since there were no estimated sizes for VIEWs.</p> <p>Part of how Postgres constructs its query plans depend on tunable parameters in its configuration file. More information on how Postgres constructs its query plans can be found on the Postgres website.</p>

40528566	1	How to aggregate values over a bigger than RAM gzip'ed csv file? <p>For starters I am new to bioinformatics and especially to programming, but I have built a script that will go through a so-called VCF file (only the individuals are included, one clumn = one individual), and uses a search string to find out for every variant (line) whether the individual is homozygous or heterozygous.</p> <p>This script works, at least on small subsets, but I know it stores everything in memory. I would like to do this on very large zipped files (of even whole genomes), but I do not know how to transform this script into a script that does everything line by line (because I want to count through whole columns I just do not see how to solve that).</p> <p>So the output is 5 things per individual (total variants, number homozygote, number heterozygote, and proportions of homo- and heterozygotes). See the code below:</p> <pre><code>#!usr/bin/env python import re import gzip subset_cols = 'subset_cols_chr18.vcf.gz' #nuc_div = 'nuc_div_chr18.txt' gz_infile = gzip.GzipFile(subset_cols, "r") #gz_outfile = gzip.GzipFile(nuc_div, "w") # make a dictionary of the header line for easy retrieval of elements later on headers = gz_infile.readline().rstrip().split('\t') print headers column_dict = {} for header in headers: column_dict[header] = [] for line in gz_infile: columns = line.rstrip().split('\t') for i in range(len(columns)): c_header=headers[i] column_dict[c_header].append(columns[i]) #print column_dict for key in column_dict: number_homozygotes = 0 number_heterozygotes = 0 for values in column_dict[key]: SearchStr = '(\d)/(\d):\d+,\d+:\d+:\d+:\d+,\d+,\d+' #this search string contains the regexp (this regexp was tested) Result = re.search(SearchStr,values) if Result: #here, it will skip the missing genoytypes ./. variant_one = int(Result.group(1)) variant_two = int(Result.group(2)) if variant_one == 0 and variant_two == 0: continue elif variant_one == variant_two: #count +1 in case variant one and two are equal (so 0/0, 1/1, etc.) number_homozygotes += 1 elif variant_one != variant_two: #count +1 in case variant one is not equal to variant two (so 1/0, 0/1, etc.) number_heterozygotes += 1 print "%s homozygotes %s" % (number_homozygotes, key) print "%s heterozygotes %s" % (number_heterozygotes,key) variants = number_homozygotes + number_heterozygotes print "%s variants" % variants prop_homozygotes = (1.0*number_homozygotes/variants)*100 prop_heterozygotes = (1.0*number_heterozygotes/variants)*100 print "%s %% homozygous %s" % (prop_homozygotes, key) print "%s %% heterozygous %s" % (prop_heterozygotes, key) </code></pre> <p>Any help will be much appreciated so I can go on investigating large datasets, thank you :)</p> <p>The VCF file by the way looks something like this: INDIVIDUAL_1 INDIVIDUAL_2 INDIVIDUAL_3 0/0:9,0:9:24:0,24,221 1/0:5,4:9:25:25,0,26 1/1:0,13:13:33:347,33,0</p> <p>This is then the header line with the individual ID names (I have in total 33 individuals with more complicated ID tags, I simplified here) and then I have a lot of these information lines with the same specific pattern. I am only interested in the first part with the slash so hence the regular epxression.</p>

The F3 key command will then also not be routed to the browser. So what you need to do, is make sure that your application has focus when the user hits F3. How you solve this will depend on your JavaScript implementation. You could use ExternalInterface to tell the browser that the app is ready and than focus on the app. Or in Javascript you could catch the keyboard event, prevent its default behavior, and then call the function on the Flash app (again through ExternalInterface).</p> <p>To get you started, here's a little JQuery snippet for preventing the default F3 behaviour:</p> <pre><code>$('body').keyup(function(event) { if (event.keyCode == '114') event.preventDefault(); } </code></pre>

19975386	0	 <p>Threads do not work, abstain from that approach.</p> <p>Creating several threads fails, as you have noticed, because only one thread has a current OpenGL context. In principle, you <em>could</em> make the context current in each worker thread before calling <code>glReadPixels</code>, but this will require extra synchronization from your side (otherwise, a thread could be preempted in between making the context current and reading back!), and <code>(wgl|glx)MakeCurrent</code> is a terribly slow function that will seriously stall OpenGL. In the end, you'll be doing <em>more work</em> to get something much <em>slower</em>.</p> <p>There is no way to make <code>glReadPixels</code> any faster<sup>1</sup>, but you can decouple the time it takes (i.e. the readback runs asynchronously), so it does not block your application and effectively <em>appears</em> to run "faster".<br> You want to use a <a href="http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_pbo.html#pack">Pixel buffer object</a> for that. Be sure to get the buffer flags correct.</p> <p>Note that mapping the buffer to access its contents will <em>still</em> block if the complete contents hasn't finished transferring, so it will <em>still</em> not be any faster. To account for that, you either have to read the previous frame, or use a fence object which you can query to be sure that it's done.<br> Or, simpler but less reliable, you can insert "some other work" in between <code>glReadPixels</code> and accessing the data. This will not guarantee that the transfer has finished by the time you access the data, so it may still block. However, it <em>may</em> just work, and it will <em>likely</em> block for a shorter time (thus run "faster").</p> <p><hr /> <sup>1</sup> There are plenty of ways of making it <em>slower</em>, e.g. if you ask OpenGL to do some weird conversions or if you use wrong buffer flags. However, generally, there's no way to make it faster since its speed depends on all previous draw commands having finished before the transfer can even start, and the data being transferred over the PCIe bus (which has a fixed time overhead plus a finite bandwidth).<br> The only viable way of making readbacks "faster" is hiding this latency. It's of course still not faster, but you don't get to feel it.</p>

PHPTAL templates are valid XML (and hence XHTML) files. You can farther use dummy content in PHPTAL and so get valid XHTML file with the final appearance, that can be processed and tested with standard tools. Here is a small example:</p> <pre><code>&lt;table&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;First Name&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Last Name&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Age&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr tal:repeat="users user"&gt; &lt;td tal:content="user/first_name"&gt;Max&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td tal:content="user/last_name"&gt;Mustermann&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td tal:content="user/age"&gt;29&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; </code></pre> <p>PHPTAL template engine will automatically insert all values from users array and replace our dummy values. Nevertheless, the table is already valid XHTML that can be displayed in a browser of your choice.</p>

If you have a .NET <code>DateTime</code> in your application with some decimal places filled and want to store that in a <code>datetime</code> type in SQL Server the value will (and can only) be stored as a rounded value. It doesn't matter if the rounding happens on client side before the SQL is sent to the database server or if the rounding happens on the database server itself. The result will be the same: A rounded stored value with a loss of precision.</p>

10122569	0	 <p>Relations are defined by predicates in Prolog. There is no built-in (but you could do it for example by using term expansion) syntactic way to define predicates inside predicates in program text, and there seems little reason to do so. You can simply write separate predicates and refer to them. You <em>can</em> of course have nested terms, that is terms as subterms of other terms. </p> <p>What do you mean with</p> <pre><code>relation(CctypeInt,[0-{2,3,4}, 1-{2,3,4}, 2-{2}],Ru1),!. </code></pre> <p>? This is a clause that states something about the predicate (,)/2 , which I doubt was the intention. On the other hand, you can of course build and use a Prolog term like</p> <pre><code>relation(cctypeint,relation(ru_1,...,ru_n)) </code></pre> <p>in your programs to represent your data.</p>

19327731	0	How to find the vertical and horizontal distance from the center of a rectangle <p>For my current Java project I have to compute the horizontal and vertical distance from the center of a rectangle. I tried using the formula from a previous project to find such a distance. Here is my code:</p> <pre><code> // Calculations; centerCoordinate = 0 formula = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(userXCoordinate - centerCoordinate, 2) + Math.pow(userYCoordinate - centerCoordinate, 2)); </code></pre> <p>My professor gave the hint that a point is in the rectangle if its horizontal distance to (0, 0) is less than or equal to 10 / 2 and its vertical distance to (0, 0) is less than or equal to 5 / 2. I tried using 5 for horizontal distance and 2.5 for vertical distance and setting variables to these numbers. I then made an if-else loop saying if the result of the formula was less than or equal to the variables the coordinates were in the rectangle otherwise they were outside. This returned a wrong answer; what could I do differently? </p>

10176059	0	 <p>The images you are using might be too large for an animation. How large are they? In an animation, Android loads all of the images into memory and uncompresses them meaning that every pixel will take 4 bytes. So 50k would mean that your image is 111px x 111px. It seems from the error each frame is about 480 x 640, which is really large. Try using smaller images.</p>

32129237	0	 <p>Let's start by getting some terminology out of the way</p> <ul> <li>A <em>channel</em> is a monaural stream of samples. The term does not necessarily imply that the samples are contiguous in the data stream. </li> <li>A <em>frame</em> is a set of co-incident samples. For stereo audio (e.g. L &amp; R channels) a frame contains two samples.</li> <li>A <em>packet</em> is 1 or more frames, and is typically the minimun number of frames that can be processed by a system at once. For PCM Audio, a packet often contains 1 frame, but for compressed audio it will be larger. </li> <li><em>Interleaving</em> is a term typically used for stereo audio, in which the data stream consists of consecutive frames of audio.

To put this data in a table in google visualization numbers are written as they are but string values need to have a ' either side of the text.

Is there a way in any of these formats to make all string variables have the ' either side and all numbers to be written by themselves.

Now I'd like to implement an UNDO option. My thought was to do a</p> <pre><code> canvasBackup$ = $('#canvas').clone(); </code></pre> <p>when an operation began, say at every dragStart event, and at the end of the operation an UNDO, if asked for with Ctrl-Z, would execute</p> <pre><code> $('#canvas').remove(); canvasBackup$.appendTo($('#canvasContainer'); </code></pre> <p>My concern is that the clone, and perhaps the append, might be a bit compute intensive as the page grows and start slowing down the page's responsiveness. I suppose it depends on how jQuery does the clone. If it just breaks off the section from the DOM and does a straight memory copy, it shouldn't be bad. But if there's a lot of calculation and building going on it could be a problem.</p> <p>Does anyone have a feel for whether this is a reasonable approach to implementing UNDO?</p> <p>Thanks</p>

You can instantiate a universally quantified hypothesis and you can instantiate an existentially quantified conclusion, but not vice versa. I'm thinking the proper name is "introduction". You can introduce existential quantification in a hypothesis and you can introduce universal quantification in the conclusion.

You should be using the <code>title</code> attribute for this.</p> <p>Using <code>alt</code> works this way for historic reasons in some browsers (I believe it works in IE, but not much else), but it is <em>not</em> intended as a tooltip. The correct use of <code>alt</code> is for a small bit of descriptive text that will appear if the image is not loaded. This could be because the file failed to load, or the user has images turned off, or the user has a text-to-speech browser, etc, but if the image is displayed, then this text should never be displayed.</p> <p>The <code>title</code> attribute on the other hand is intended to be displayed, and all browsers implement it as a tooltip (in fact, it's not just on <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags; you can use <code>title</code> for <em>any</em> element).</p> <p>Hope that helps.</p>

Using it could get quite confusing really fast so here's a essentials. You could create class around it in C++ if you want.</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;pango/pangocairo.h&gt; // Pango context PangoContext* pangoContext = pango_font_map_create_context( pango_cairo_font_map_get_default()); // Layout and attributes PangoLayout* pangoLayout = pango_layout_new(pangoContext); pango_layout_set_wrap(pangoLayout, PANGO_WRAP_WORD_CHAR); pango_layout_set_width(pangoLayout, maxWidth * PANGO_SCALE); pango_layout_set_height(pangoLayout, maxHeight * PANGO_SCALE); // Set font PangoFontDescription* fontDesc = pango_font_description_from_string("Verdana 10"); pango_layout_set_font_description(pangoLayout, fontDesc); pango_font_description_free(fontDesc); // Set text to render pango_layout_set_text(pangoLayout, text.data(), text.length()); // Allocate buffer const cairo_format_t format = CAIRO_FORMAT_A8; const int stride = cairo_format_stride_for_width(format, maxWidth); GLubyte* buffer = new GLubyte[stride * maxHeight]; std::fill(buffer, buffer + stride * maxHeight, 0); // Create cairo surface for buffer cairo_surface_t* crSurface = cairo_image_surface_create_for_data( buffer, format, maxWidth, maxHeight, stride); if (cairo_surface_status(crSurface) != CAIRO_STATUS_SUCCESS) { // Error } // Create cairo context cairo_t* crContext = cairo_create(crSurface); if (cairo_status(crContext) != CAIRO_STATUS_SUCCESS) { // Error } // Draw cairo_set_source_rgb(crContext, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0); pango_cairo_show_layout(crContext, pangoLayout); // Cleanup cairo_destroy(crContext); cairo_surface_destroy(crSurface); g_object_unref(pangoLayout); g_object_unref(pangoContext); // TODO: you can do whatever you want with buffer now // copy on the texture maybe? delete[] buffer; </code></pre> <p>In this case buffer will contain 8 bit alpha channel values only.

19828260	0	 <p>You are getting all 1s because the loop initialization statement <code>int c= x*y</code> will be executed only once for a <code>for</code> loop. That is it is executed the first time when <code>x=1</code> and <code>y=1</code> and since, it is given as the loop initialisation statement and not in the loop body, it is never reevaluated. The for loop works as :</p> <p>The loop initialisation statement is executed only once at the beginning of the loop. After each iteration the loop update expression is executed and the loop condition is reevaluated. <code>for(loop_initialisation;loop_condition;loop_update) { ... }</code></p> <p>So you should update <code>c</code> inside the loop, something like :</p> <pre><code>for ( int c= x*y; y&lt;= 12; y++) { c = x*y; System.out.print(c + " "); } </code></pre>

21652345	0	From inside a custom directive how to change text of another span element? <p>I have an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> which holds my custom directive as an attribute and inside that attribute I give the ID of destination that will receive the text. At the moment I am doing the text change with jQuery but I would rather use the full Angular way...So it's kinda of a binding but from within a directive. To make it simple, I made a simple draft of my code: <br><br>HTML Code</p> <pre><code>&lt;input type="text" name="input1" my-directive="message1" /&gt; &lt;span id="message1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; </code></pre> <p>JS Code</p> <pre><code>// Angular - custom Directive directive('myDirective', function($log) { return{ require: "ngModel", link: function(scope, elm, attrs, ctrl) { var receiverId = attrs.myDirective; var whateverText = 'blabla'; $('#'+receiverId).text(whateverText); } }; }); </code></pre> <p>Using the ID on my <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element is probably not the best solution, but that is how I got it working with jQuery. It's probably better to remove the ID, but then how could I update the text in my span after all? And let's not forget that it's a Form and we can have multiple input and span elements. Also note that I do not want to use the controller to pass the text, it has to stay within the directive as I want to re-use it. <br><br>Please don't tell me that I shouldn't do it this way, I want to stick with this behavior. </p>

In the OP's example, <code>block</code> is <code>nil</code>, thus <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.1/libdoc/set/rdoc/Set.html#method-i-merge" rel="nofollow"><code>#merge</code></a> is called:</p> <pre><code># File set.rb, line 351 def merge(enum) if enum.instance_of?(self.class) @hash.update(enum.instance_variable_get(:@hash)) else # in your case this else part will be executed. do_with_enum(enum) { |o| add(o) } end self end </code></pre> <p>Hence <code>add</code> is called for each element of <code>enum</code> (<code>[1,2]</code>). Here, you overrode the original <code>#add</code> method, and within that method, you are calling the old <code>#add</code> method with the argument <code>5</code>.</p> <p>Set implements a collection of <strong>unordered values with no duplicates</strong>. Thus even if you added <code>5</code> twice, you are getting only one <code>5</code>. This is the reason you are not getting <code>#&lt;Set: {1,2}&gt;</code>, but <code>#&lt;Set: {5}&gt;</code>. As below, when you call <code>Set.new</code>, the object <code>#&lt;Set: {5}&gt;</code> is created just as I explained above:</p> <pre><code>require 'set' class Set alias :old_add :add def add(arg) arg = 5 old_add arg end end s = Set.new ([1,2]) s # =&gt; #&lt;Set: {5}&gt; </code></pre> <p>When you called <code>s.add(3)</code>, your overridden <code>add</code> method was called, and it again passed the <code>5</code> to the old <code>add</code> method. As I said earlier, <code>Set</code> doesn't contain duplicate values, thus the object will still be the same as the earlier <code>#&lt;Set: {5}&gt;</code>.</p>

19886884	0	 <p>Based on my comments above, below is a workaround. Unfortunately at this stage, Windows 8.1 store Unit Test project types, using NUnit extension wouldn't work due to the different .NET targets. I tried with different Test Unit Adapters including an <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnitTestAdapter.WithFramework/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">NUnitTestAdapterWithFramework</a>. </p> <p>It seems that the issue you haveing was occurring with standard .NET libraries targeting NUnit test adapter but the above NUnitTestAdapterWithFramework must have fixed those issue. See the <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/6ab922d0-21c0-4f06-ab5f-4ecd1fe7175d/view/Reviews/3" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Q &amp; A section of the NUnitTestExtension</a></p> <p>But unfortunatly it seems that this still of an issue that hasn't been fixed for Win8 Store App type Unit Testing. Pretty sure <a href="http://xunit.codeplex.com/workitem/9826" rel="nofollow noreferrer">xUnit.NET also not compatible</a> yet with different .NET target types (i,e WinRT)</p> <p>So what are the options? a. For your group, you can change them to use MSTest framework. Outcome - Problem Solved no issues.</p> <p>b. Workaround "linked project". Outcome - Can't *guarantee** but this should also work.</p> <p><strong>With option 'b'</strong></p> <p>In your comment you mentioned.</p> <blockquote> <p>but I'm still not sure what it does or how to implement a 'linked project', do you have any more information on this? Also, as this is for a group university project, I was hoping i wouldn't have to force too many workarounds</p> </blockquote> <p>When you think about it, it is not really hard work around. It is simple and I'm sure your group would be able to apply this workaround easily.</p> <p>Please follow the below steps.</p> <ol> <li><p>Create a separate class library in your solution (you can target .NET framework 4).</p></li> <li><p>Then add NUnit assemblies and the NUnit test adapter as usual.</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jxZU8.png" alt="enter image description here"></p></li> <li><p>Right click on this project and select 'Add' then 'Existing Item'</p></li> <li><p>Select the Win8 Store Unit Test project and locate the Unit Test file you want to add. When you add the file, make sure you select 'Add As a Link' button. Please see below.</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GIx7g.png" alt="enter image description here"></p></li> <li><p>Now rebuild the solution, close and re-open the UnitTest explorer and you should be able to run those tests.</p></li> </ol> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p6AiB.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>*The reason I said can't guaranteed. I haven't really written Unit tests against Win8 App. So if your SUT (System Under Test) require special configuration it might cause issues. But I'm not sure.</p> <p><strong>Finally creating a link files are not that hard if everything works you can continue to do this until NUnit has the support for Win8 Unit Testing. Or the other option is simply change all your Unit Tests to use MSTest framework if possible.</strong></p>

23109791	0	 <p>I had a similar problem recently, specifically making the width match the parent div and also respond. I couldn't work out why Trust Pilot thought it appropriate to set something to make the height of the frame dynamic and not the width, but anyway.</p> <p>Firstly, I had some CSS for the parent div, like:</p> <pre><code>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt; div.trust-pilot{ width: 100% !important; height: auto; } &lt;/style&gt; </code></pre> <p>This may not actually be necessary, but I put it there anyway.</p> <p>These are the 'trustbox' settings I used (see <a href="http://trustpilot.github.io/developers/#trustbox" rel="nofollow">http://trustpilot.github.io/developers/#trustbox</a>):</p> <pre><code>&lt;div id="trust-pilot" class="trust-pilot"&gt; &lt;div class="tp_-_box" data-tp-settings="domainId: xxxxxxx, bgColor: F5F5F5, showRatingText: False, showComplementaryText: False, showUserImage: False, showDate: False, width: -1, numOfReviews: 6, useDynamicHeight: False, height: 348 "&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; (function () { var a = "https:" == document.location.protocol ? "https://ssl.trustpilot.com" : "http://s.trustpilot.com", b = document.createElement("script"); b.type = "text/javascript"; b.async = true; b.src = a + "/tpelements/tp_elements_all.js"; var c = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; c.parentNode.insertBefore(b, c) })(); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre> <p>Replace the domainId with something valid (in the case of this question, it's 3660907). Note that the width: -1 parameter might work already for you except if you want the page to be responsive (that is below).</p> <p>Firstly, to make the width match the parent div, I used:</p> <pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; jQuery( window ).load(function() { _width = jQuery('#trust-pilot').innerWidth(); jQuery('#tpiframe-box0').attr('width',_width); }); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre> <p>And then to make the box respond, I used:</p> <pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; jQuery( window ).resize(function() { _width = jQuery('#trust-pilot').innerWidth(); jQuery('#tpiframe-box0').attr('width',_width); }); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre> <p>I hope that this helps.

38444485	0	Use std::bind to remove arguments <p>I'm currently coding against a library that uses an event system to signify user interface interactions. Each listener can either be a pointer to an object and a function to call, or a std::function. For example, the MenuItem object defines an OnClick event that will call a function that takes a MenuItem*:</p> <pre><code>someMenuItem-&gt;OnClick.addListener( this, &amp;myObj.doSomeAction ); ... void myObj::doSomeAction( MenuItem* menuItem ) {} </code></pre> <p>or</p> <pre><code>someMenuItem-&gt;OnClick.addListener( []( MenuItem* menuItem ) {} ); </code></pre> <p>It's often the case that doSomeAction is part of the public API of the class that we might want to call for some reason other than the user selecting the menu item. Is it possible to use std::bind to throw away the MenuItem* argument so that <code>doSomeAction( MenuItem* menuItem )</code> could be defined as simply <code>doSomeAction()</code>?</p> <p>PS - I do realize that I could use lambdas to do the same thing, but if bind can do the same thing then it might be more stylistically pleasing to some.</p>

30001286	0	 <p>It is because the whitespace between the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements is significant. If you remove all whitespace, the elements will be right next to each other. Either you just do this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;li class="orange start"&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="orange center"&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; </code></pre> <p>Or, if you want to keep the line breaks in code, which I usually think is a good thing, you can insert an HTML comment like this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;li class="orange start"&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;li class="orange center"&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; </code></pre> <p>It's a matter of taste, but I tend to favor the latter because I find it more readable.</p>
16529304	0	 <p>You can try swapping backgrounds like so:</p> <p>Create CSS Class for each background and include transitions as part of the ruleset:</p> <pre><code>.background-1 { background: url('background-1.jpg'); -webkit-transition: background 500ms linear; -moz-transition: background 500ms linear; -o-transition: background 500ms linear; -ms-transition: background 500ms linear; transition: background 500ms linear; </code></pre> <p>}</p> <p>Add a script that will swap out the classes on a regular interval. (You would most likely wrap this script within $(document).ready) Since your transitioning backgrounds, you may not want the previous background immediately removed, so you can use a delay call to remove it after the transition would complete.</p> <p>The following example would start the background switch every two seconds, and remove the previous background after 1 second. Since in my CSS, I declared that the transition should take .5 seconds, the new background is already there before the old one is removed:</p> <pre><code>setInterval(function() { if($('#background').hasClass('background-1')) { $('#background').addClass('background-2'); setTimeout(function() { $('#background').removeClass('background-1'); }, 1000); } else if($('#background').hasClass('background-2')) { $('#background').addClass('background-1'); setTimeout(function() { $('#background').removeClass('background-2'); }, 1000); } }, 2000); </code></pre> <p>Note: The code that I've provided would require you to chain multiple if/else if statements together, there is probably a more efficient way to go about this. </p> <p>I've done something similar (background colors instead of images) as a teaser for an upcoming project of mine, you can check it out <a href="http://www.theaccordance.com" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> Forgot to mention, make sure to declare one of the background classes in your Div element:</p> <pre><code>&lt;div id="background" class="background-1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>

12552139	0	 <p>Because you work with statically allocated arrays you probably stumbled upon writing after the end of the array.</p> <p>You state that the file has exactly 21 entries but what happens with the eof condition? If you read the last entry, the stream still doesn't have the eof bit set. This only happens when you try to read and there is nothing. After the 21st entry, the loop still continues because the eof bit is not set. It reads garbage information and tries to store it into paInventory[21], but the array was only 21 in size.</p> <pre><code>//after last read x=21 and eof not set while (!InputInventory.eof () ) { //first read causes eof to be set InputInventory &gt;&gt; iTempPluCode &gt;&gt; sTempDescription &gt;&gt; dTempPrice &gt;&gt; iTempType &gt;&gt; dTempInventory; //Accessing paInventory[21] here which causes your error paInventory[x].setiPluCode(iTempPluCode); //...// } </code></pre>

37892431	0	 <p>The short answer is: you use a generational garbage collector. </p> <p>Except that most modern Java implementations<sup>1</sup> use a generational collector <em>by default</em>. In other words, you (the programmer) don't need to deal with the problem because it is already dealt with.</p> <p>The only situation where you might run into fragmentation is if you have mis-tuned the low-pause collector and it has fallen back to doing a "stop the world" full collection. At that point, you might be using a non-compacting collector, and fragmentation might ensue.

7346621	0	 <p>No, it is not a good practice for large applications, especially not if your static variables are mutable, as they are then effectively global variables, a code smell which Object Oriented Programming was supposed to "solve".</p> <p>At the very least start by grouping your methods into smaller classes with associated functionality - the Util name indicates nothing about the purpose of your methods and smells of an incoherent class in itself.</p> <p>Second, you should always consider if a method is better implemented as a (non-static) method on the same object where the data that is passed as argument(s) to the method lives.</p> <p>Finally, if your application is quite large and/or complex, you can consider solutions such as an Inversion of Control container, which can reduce the dependency on global state. However, ASP.Net webforms is notoriously hard to integrate into such an environment, as the framework is very tightly coupled in itself.</p>

2444704	0	 <p>The construct you are looking for is called <code>column_property</code>. You could use a secondary mapper to actually replace the amount column. Are you sure you are not making things too difficult for yourself by not just storing the negative values in the database directly or giving the "corrected" column a different name?</p> <pre><code>from sqlalchemy.orm import mapper, column_property wrongmapper = sqlalchemy.orm.mapper(Transaction, Transaction.__table, non_primary = True, properties = {'amount': column_property(case([(Transaction.transfer_account_id==1, -1*Transaction.amount)], else_=Transaction.amount)}) Session.query(wrongmapper).filter(...) </code></pre>
30758924	0	 <blockquote> <ol> <li>Do I really need to use a mutex in a thread each time I access the data from the read-only array? If so could you explain why?</li> </ol> </blockquote> <p>No. Because the data is never modified, there cannot be synchronization problem.</p> <blockquote> <ol start="2"> <li>Do I need to use a mutex in a thread when it writes to the result array even though this will be the only thread that ever writes to this element?</li> </ol> </blockquote> <p>Depends.</p> <ol> <li>If any other thread is going to read the element, you need synchronization.</li> <li>If any thread may modify the size of the vector, you need synchronization.</li> </ol> <p>In any case, take care of not writing into adjacent memory locations by different threads a lot. That could destroy the performance. See "false sharing". Considering, you probably don't have a lot of cores and therefore not a lot of threads and you say write is done only once, this is probably not going to be a significant problem though.</p> <blockquote> <ol start="3"> <li>Should I use atomic data types and will there be any significant time over head if I do?</li> </ol> </blockquote> <p>If you use locks (mutex), atomic variables are not necessary (and they do have overhead). If you need no synchronization, atomic variables are not necessary. If you need synchronization, then atomic variables can be used to avoid locks in some cases. In which cases can you use atomics instead of locks... is more complicated and beyond the scope of this question I think.</p> <p>Given the description of your situation in the comments, it seems that no synchronization is required at all and therefore no atomics nor locks.</p> <blockquote> <ol start="4"> <li>...Would my array elements in this example be aligned, or is there some way to ensure they are?</li> </ol> </blockquote> <p>As pointed out by Arvid, you can request specific alignment using the <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/alignas" rel="nofollow">alginas</a> keyword which was introduced in c++11.

Alternatively, if you are using one of the various techniques that supposedly allow you to run multiple versions of IE on the same machine, be aware that the results are not perfect, and often cause subtle aspects of the browser to break on one or more of the versions: for example, see <a href="http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE#comment-1843" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this comment on Tredosoft's Multiple IE page</a> about cookies failing in IE 6.</p>

28332602	0	 <p>The code you've shared seems very close. See below to output the first child <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> of the table, if an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element is found, then stop looping through additional <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements. What specific problems are you having with your code?</p> <pre><code>foreach ($html-&gt;find('table') as $name) { foreach ($name-&gt;find('a') as $elem) { echo $name-&gt;find('tr', 0)-&gt;plaintext; // echo first TR element echo $elem-&gt;plaintext.'&lt;br&gt;'; // echo A element break 1; // skip to the next table } } </code></pre>
6520463	0	 <p>You only need virtual functions if you've set up an inheritance chain, and you want to override the default implementation of a function defined in the base class in a derived class.</p> <p>The classic example is something as follows:</p> <pre><code>public class Animal { public virtual void Speak() { Console.WriteLine("..."); } } public class Dog : Animal { public override void Speak() { Console.WriteLine("Bow-wow"); } } public class Human : Animal { public override void Speak() { Console.WriteLine("Hello, how are you?"); } } </code></pre> <p>Both the <code>Dog</code> and <code>Human</code> classes inherit from the base <code>Animal</code> class, because they're both types of animals. But they both speak in very different ways, so they need to override the <code>Speak</code> function to provide their own unique implementation.</p> <p>In certain circumstances, it can be beneficial to use the same pattern when designing your own classes because this enables <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_%28computer_science%29" rel="nofollow">polymorphism</a>, which is essentially where different classes share a common interface and can be handled similarly by your code.</p> <p>But I'll echo what others have suggested in the comments: learning object-oriented programming properly is not something you're going to be able to do by asking a few Stack Overflow questions. It's a complicated topic, and one well-worth investing your time as a developer learning. I highly advise picking up a book on object-oriented programming (and in particular, one written for the C# language) and going through the examples. OOP is a very powerful tool when used correctly, but can definitely become a hindrance when designed poorly!</p>

38052792	0	 <p>It depends on your CPU architecture how the communication happens, but it is usually via a special place in RAM, flash or the filesystem. No data structures are transferred, they would be meaningless to the kernel and the memory space will be different between the two. Uboot generally passes boot parameters like what type of hardware is present, what memory to use for something, or which type of mode to use for a specific driver. So yes, the kernel will re-initialize the hardware. The exception may be some of the low level CPU specifics which the kernel may expect uboot or a BIOS to have setup already.</p>

5765020	0	 <p>Mocha is a traditional mocking library very much in the JMock mould. Stubba is a separate part of Mocha that allows mocking and stubbing of methods on real (non-mock) classes. It works by moving the method of interest to one side, adding a new stubbed version of the method which delegates to a traditional mock object. You can use this mock object to set up stubbed return values or set up expectations of methods to be called. After the test completes the stubbed version of the method is removed and replaced by the original.</p> <p>for more detail with example </p> <p><a href="http://jamesmead.org/blog/2006-09-11-the-difference-between-mocks-and-stubs" rel="nofollow">http://jamesmead.org/blog/2006-09-11-the-difference-between-mocks-and-stubs</a></p>

Note that when you set ReadPreference at these levels, it applies for all callers (i.e. these objects are shared across threads).</p> <p>Another approach is to try the ReadPreference.SECONDARY and if it fails, try without it and go to the master. This logic can be isolated to your repository layer, so the service layer doesn't have to deal with it.

38113933	0	 <p>Plivo Sales Engineer here.</p> <p>Pavan is correct. You need to specify the <code>Content-Type</code> header as <code>application/json</code> for Parse to make a JSON string of the body: </p> <pre><code> headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }, </code></pre> <p>You also should <code>console.log(httpResponse)</code> (aka the Plivo API response) which will tell if you are doing something wrong (sending the wrong data, not authenticating correctly) or if you do something right. Either way it will show you an <code>api_id</code> which you can use to look in your <a href="https://manage.plivo.com/logs/debug/" rel="nofollow">Plivo account dashboard debug logs</a> and figure out what need to be changed. You can also go directly to the debug logs for a specific <code>api_id</code> by making a url like this: <code>https://manage.plivo.com/logs/debug/api/e58b26e5-3db5-11e6-a069-22000afa135b/</code> and replacing <code>e58b26e5-3db5-11e6-a069-22000afa135b</code> with the <code>api_id</code> returned by your <code>Parse.Cloud.httpRequest</code></p>

27595996	0	Changing static content directory <p>I am trying to set the express.static path to something different based on a session variable. The relevant code is below.</p> <pre><code>app.use( '/', function(req, res, next ) { if ( req.session.loggedIn ) { console.log("loggedIn : " + req.session.loggedIn); app.use('/', express.static(__dirname + '/private')); next(); } else { console.log("not logged in."); app.use('/', express.static(__dirname + '/public')); next(); } }); </code></pre> <p>When I start the application, I begin with not having req.session.loggedIn set. So it will use the static content in the /public directory (which contains an angular powered application for public users.) I then do a login (code below)</p> <pre><code>app.post('/login', function( req, res ) { req.session.loggedIn = true; var message = {}; message.success = true; message.text = "Logging you in..."; res.json(message); }); </code></pre> <p>Which sets the req.session.loggedIn variable to be true. I then hit refresh on the page (and have tried hard refresh, and cache clear/refresh as well). The console.log tells me "loggedIn : true" as expected, however it does NOT load the static content from the /private directory. It instead continues to load from the /public directory.</p> <p>Can anyone shed light on this issue?</p>

4245046	0	Change background of title and header in pivot control <p>In my Phone 7 application, I'm using a pivot control. Now I'd like to change the background of its title and header area. How can I achieve this?</p> <p>Is there an overall template for the pivot control that can be customized?</p> <p>I've already tried to set the background of the grid containing the pivot control to the header color and then to set the background of each pivot item to the original background color.

6153541	0	 <p>I found the problem/solution!</p> <p>The problem is that in my Controller_Website I had this in my <code>action_before()</code>:</p> <pre><code>// Create a new DM_Nav object to hold our page info // Make this page info available to all views as well $this-&gt;page_info = new DM_Nav; View::bind_global('page_info', $this-&gt;page_info); </code></pre> <p>The problem is the <code>bind_global</code> – which is actually <em>working as it's supposed to</em> by letting you change the value of this variable after the fact... <em>(A very neat feature indeed.)</em></p> <p>The workaround/solution was to force the template to use only the original <code>page_info</code> by detecting if it was an initial/main request. So at the very end of the <code>action_before()</code> method of <code>Controller_Website</code> where it says:</p> <pre><code>// Only if auto_render is still TRUE (Default) if ($this-&gt;auto_render === TRUE AND $this-&gt;request-&gt;is_initial()) { </code></pre> <p>I added this line to the end of that <code>if</code> statement:</p> <pre><code> $this-&gt;template-&gt;page_info = $this-&gt;page_info; } </code></pre> <p>This line is redundant on initial/main requests, but it means that any additional sub-requests can still have access to their own <code>page_info</code> values without affecting the values used in the template. It appears, then, that if you assign a property to a view and then attempt to <code>bind_global()</code> the same property with new values, it doesn't overwrite it and uses the original values instead... <em>(Which is why this solution works.)</em> Interesting.</p>

22144512	0	 <p>There are some different matters in your question. First of all:</p> <p>1: I don't really understand what you do in your query, but the limit clause must be at the end of a query, so you could try </p> <pre><code>select * from A join B on A.id = B.id limit 10 </code></pre> <p>And this should work. More info on:</p> <p><a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/select.html" rel="nofollow">https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/select.html</a></p> <p>2: Join vs. IN clause: the IN clause should always perform worse than the join. Imagine something like:</p> <pre><code>select * from A where A.id in (select id from B) </code></pre> <p>This will do a full scan on B table (<code>select id from B</code> subquery) and then another full scan on A to try match the results.</p> <p>However, </p> <pre><code>select * from A join B on A.id = B.id </code></pre> <p>should do a hash join between both tables, and if you have planned it right, id will be an index column, so it should be quite faster (and do no full scans on neither of them)</p>

10938897	0	 <p>There are three alternatives for unsolvable hash collisions on open addressing hash tables:</p> <ol> <li>Re-hash the entire table with a different hash function, and hope that no new unsolvable hash collisions occur.</li> <li>Resize the table (with all operations that this might incur), to guarantee some more possible slots.</li> <li>Keep a separate list for unsolvable hash collisions.</li> </ol> <p>None of those options are good. </p> <p>What you should do is to carefully chose your probing method in combination with the hash table size. If your table size was odd, with the same constant step, you would not run in this problem while there was still space in the table.</p> <p>Popular combinations include quadratic probing with a prime-sized hash table, that guarantees insertion success if the table is less than half-full, and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2349774/1157317">quadratic probing with triangular numbers and power of 2 hash table</a>, that guarantees insertion if the table isn't full.

39355129	0	 <p>Since you have 4 columns including the primary key column, you have to provide data for all four columns.

Basically the idea is that you have interfaces that acts as a facade on database and ORM operations.</p> <pre><code>interface IFetchUsers { UserList GetAll(); User GetById(int id); } interface ICalculateDebt { float GetDebt(int accountId); } interface IPersistOrder { void Save(Order order); } </code></pre> <p>(forgive syntax errors, it's been a long time since I've done Java.)</p> <p>These are injected via the constructor into your other classes and become trivial to <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html" rel="nofollow">mock, or even stub</a>.</p> <p>Then, for actual db code you just implement these interfaces. You can even put all implementations in a single class.</p> <p>And that's it. No need to get fancy, but if you do want to get into fancier versions of this look into the repository design pattern (though I would argue that its not really necessary if using a good ORM).</p>

13026080	0	 <p>If you want to <strong>AUTOMATICALLY</strong> redirect from <code>www.google.com</code> to <code>www.google.com#something</code> you can use firefox's redirector addon.<br/> Whenever you load www.google.com, the addon will automatically change the URL in the location bar to www.google.com#something (or whatever you specify.) <br/><br/> Alternately, you could use firefox addon, called greasemonkey, to write the 1 line script given by Jacob. That will also serve the purpose.</p> <p>Off course, both these solutions are specific to firefox.</p>

The next time when your app runs, read the license from the cache, and also start a Thread that gets the license from your server. If the license that you got from the server is now invalid. You can pop up a dialog box to tell the user that the license is invalid, remove the cached license, and quit the app.</p>

2579588	0	Incorrect emacs indentation in a C++ class with DLL export specification <p>I often write classes with a DLL export/import specification, but this seems to confuse emacs' syntax parser. I end up with something like:</p> <pre><code>class myDllSpec Foo { public: Foo( void ); }; </code></pre> <p>Notice that the "public:" access spec is indented incorrectly, as well as everything that follows it.</p> <p>When I ask emacs to describe the syntax at the beginning of the line containing public, I get a return of:</p> <pre><code>((label 352)) </code></pre> <p>If I remove the myDllSpec, the indentation is correct, and emacs tells me that the syntax there is:</p> <pre><code>((inclass 352) (access-label 352)) </code></pre> <p>Which seems correct and reasonable. So I conclude that the syntax parser is not able to handle the DLL export spec, and that this is what's causing my indentation trouble.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I don't know how to teach the parser about my labels. Seems that this is pretty common practice, so I'm hoping there's a way around it.</p>
30643331	0	How can I wait for an application launched by another application launched by my application Qt/C++ <p>I'm creating a Windows Add/Remove Programs application in Qt 5.4 and I'm becaming crazy to solve a little "puzzle":</p> <p>My application (APP_0) runs another application (APP_1) and waits for this APP_1 until it terminates. </p> <p>APP_1 is an uninstaller (i.e. uninstall.exe) and I've not the source code of the APP_1, just of my Qt APP_0.</p> <p>APP_1, instead of doing the uninstall job, it simply copies itself somewhere in the filesystem (I saw as Au_.exe but other apps could use different names and locations), runs this copy of itself (APP_2) and terminates.</p> <p>The APP_2 has a GUI and the job I'm waiting for (uninstall) is demanded to the final user of the running APP_2.</p> <p>In this situation my application (APP_0) stops waiting for APP_1 pratically immediately (because it launches APP_1 and waits for APP_1). But to work properly, obviously, I need to know instead when APP_2 is terminated...</p> <p>So the question is: is there a way (using some techniques (hooking?)) to know if and when APP_2 terminates?</p> <p>Note: Consider that the standard Windows Add/Remove Programs utility does the job successfully (it seems it waits for APP_2). You can test this, for example, installing Adobe Digital Edition. Its uninstaller (uninstall.exe) copies itself into a new folder in the User_Local_Temp folder as Au_.exe, runs it and terminates. But the OS utility successfully waits for Au_.exe and only after it terminates refreshes the list of installed programs.</p> <p>If this kind of technique (uninstall.exe copies itself somewhere ALWAYS with THE SAME name (Au_.exe) ) the problem could be resolved, obviously, very simply. But I don't think that the name of the copied uninstaller is always the same and also I don't like to assume things I'm not sure are real.</p> <p>Many thanks in advance</p>

15361648	0	 <p>There are likely to be several "problems", or ways to make it faster. I wouldn't call them "bottlenecks" because often they are not localized. Typically they are perfectly good code - it was just never supposed that they would be on the "critical path".</p> <p>Suppose the problems, when fixed, would save these percentages:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EFeVX.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>Just finding one of them would give you a certain amount of speedup. Like if you just find A, that would give you a speedup of 1/(1-0.3) = 1.43 or 43%. If you did that, you could, like most people, be happy and stop. However, if you continued and also found B, your total speedup would be 1/(1-0.51) = 2.04 or 104%. That's a lot more than 43%, even though B was smaller than A. Fixing C brings you up to 2.92 times faster, and D brings you to 4.2 times faster.</p> <p>What? Fixing smaller problems has higher payoff? They can, because speedup factors compound. Fixing A and B in that order gives you 1.43 * 1.43 = 2.04. If you happen to fix them in the opposite order you get 1.27 * 1.61 = 2.04</p> <p>Each time you fix something, the other issues become larger, percentage-wise and easier to find, and the speedups accumulate like a high-yield investment. By the time you fix A, B, C, D, and E, the one left is F and it isn't 5%, it's 30%. Fix all of them, and now you are 8.5 times faster! However, if you miss one, like D, because your profiling tool fails to expose it, you are only 4.5 times faster.</p> <p><em>That's the price you pay for not finding a problem.</em></p> <p>That's why I rely on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/378024/23771"><em>a manual technique</em></a>, because, relative to profilers, it finds all problems they find, and it finds ones they don't. Profilers are often concerned with peripheral issues, like accuracy of measurement, which doesn't help to find problems.

16184902	0	 <p>Once a program goes out of memory it can be hard for it to recover. You need to think carefully about how to try and clean up when that happens. For example, in your saveImageToExternalStorage, it doesn't clean up the fOut if an exception occurs inside your try/catch. So you should do things like put </p> <pre><code>OutputStream fOut = null; </code></pre> <p>outside the try/catch, and then close it in a finally block of the try/catch. And pay attention to the possibility of further exceptions in the catch of finally blocks.</p>

6356792	0	 <p>I thought I'd answer this one since it has a few votes, although based on Christina's other questions I don't think this will be a usable answer for her since a 50,000-word language model almost certainly won't have an acceptable word error rate or recognition speed (or most likely even function for long) with in-app recognition systems for iOS that use this format of language model currently, due to hardware constraints. I figured it was worth documenting it because I think it may be helpful to others who are using a platform where keeping a vocabulary this size in memory is more of a viable thing, and maybe it will be a possibility for future device models as well.</p> <p>There is no web-based tool I'm aware of like the Sphinx Knowledge Base Tool that will munge a 50,000-word plaintext corpus and return an ARPA language model. But, you can obtain an already-complete 64,000-word DMP language model (which can be used with Sphinx at the command line or in other platform implementations in the same way as an ARPA .lm file) with the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>Download this language model from the CMU speech site:</li> </ol> <p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/Acoustic%20and%20Language%20Models/US%20English%20HUB4%20Language%20Model/HUB4_trigram_lm.zip">http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/Acoustic%20and%20Language%20Models/US%20English%20HUB4%20Language%20Model/HUB4_trigram_lm.zip</a></p> <p>In that folder is a file called language_model.arpaformat.DMP which will be your language model.</p> <ol> <li>Download this file from the CMU speech site, which will become your pronunciation dictionary:</li> </ol> <p><a href="https://cmusphinx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cmusphinx/trunk/pocketsphinx/model/lm/en_US/cmu07a.dic">https://cmusphinx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cmusphinx/trunk/pocketsphinx/model/lm/en_US/cmu07a.dic</a></p> <p>Convert the contents of cmu07a.dic to all uppercase letters. </p> <p>If you want, you could also trim down the pronunciation dictionary by removing any words from it which aren't found in the corpus language_model.vocabulary (this would be a regex problem). These files are intended for use with one of the Sphinx English-language acoustic models.</p> <p>If the desire to use a 50,000-word English language model is driven by the idea of doing some kind of generalized large vocabulary speech recognition and not by the need to use a very specific 50,000 words (for instance, something specialized like a medical dictionary or 50,000-entry contact list), this approach should give those results if the hardware can handle it. There are probably going to be some Sphinx or Pocketsphinx settings that will need to be changed which will optimize searches through this size of model.</p>

9046428	0	 <p>You can't do that. You need to setup a delegate protocol. See <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/5191/beginning-storyboards-in-ios-5-part-2" rel="nofollow">This tutorial</a> and search down for the words "new delegate" and it will explain how that is done. That is the design pattern you need to use. There are several steps involved so follow closely. It is worth learning. Delegate protocols are common in iPhone Apps.</p> <p>In a current project I created a delegate protocol to communicate between two controller: SelectNoteViewController (Select) and EditNoteViewController (Edit). The basic idea is that Select is used to select from a list of notes and Edit is used to edit those notes. Now, I need Edit to have access back into the data and methods kept by Select because I have buttons in edit to call up the previous or next note from the list which is managed by Select so I implement a delegate protocol. Select is a delegate for Edit. That means Select does things for Edit. Here is the essential code.</p> <p>SelectNoteViewController.h:</p> <pre><code>// this next statement is need to inform Select of the protocols defined in Edit #import "EditNoteViewController.h" // STEP 1 @interface SelectNoteViewController : UITableViewController &lt;EditNoteViewControllerDelegate&gt; { ... // STEP 2: this says Select implements the protocol I created ... // STEP 3: EditNoteViewController Delegate Methods - these are the methods in the protocol - (Notes *)selectPreviousNote; - (Notes *)selectNextNote; </code></pre> <p>SelectNoteViewController.m:</p> <pre><code>// STEP 4: the protocol methods are implemented - (Notes *)selectPreviousNote { if (isPreviousToSelectedNote) { NSIndexPath *indexPath, *previousIndexPath; indexPath = [self.tableView indexPathForSelectedRow]; previousIndexPath = [NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:indexPath.row+1 inSection:0]; // update the selected row self.selectedNote = [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPath:previousIndexPath]; [self.tableView selectRowAtIndexPath:previousIndexPath animated:NO scrollPosition:UITableViewScrollPositionMiddle]; [self setPreviousNote]; [self setNextNote]; } return selectedNote; } - (Notes *)selectNextNote { if (isNextToSelectedNote) { NSIndexPath *indexPath, *nextIndexPath; indexPath = [self.tableView indexPathForSelectedRow]; nextIndexPath = [NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:indexPath.row-1 inSection:0]; // update the selected row self.selectedNote = [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPath:nextIndexPath]; [self.tableView selectRowAtIndexPath:nextIndexPath animated:NO scrollPosition:UITableViewScrollPositionMiddle]; [self setPreviousNote]; [self setNextNote]; } return selectedNote; } ... ... if ([[segue identifier] isEqualToString:@"editNote"]) { // STEP 5: this is where Edit is told that its delegate is Select [[segue destinationViewController] setEditNoteViewControllerDelegate:self]; // STEP 5 </code></pre> <p>Select now has the structure to do be a delegate for Edit. Now Edit needs to define the protocol on its end that it is going to use to get to those methods in Select.</p> <p>EditNoteViewController.h</p> <pre><code>#import ... // put protocol after import statements // STEP 6 @protocol EditNoteViewControllerDelegate &lt;NSObject&gt; - (Notes *)selectPreviousNote; - (Notes *)selectNextNote; @end @interface ... // STEP7: Edit needs a property to tell it who the delegate is - it was set back in Select.m @property (weak) id &lt;EditNoteViewControllerDelegate&gt; editNoteViewControllerDelegate; </code></pre> <p>EditNoteViewController.m</p> <pre><code>// STEP 8: the property is synthesized @synthesize editNoteViewControllerDelegate; ... // STEP 9: now when any method needs to call selectPreviousNote or selectNext Note it does it like this: selectedNote = [self.editNoteViewControllerDelegate selectPreviousNote]; // or selectedNote = [self.editNoteViewControllerDelegate selectNextNote]; </code></pre> <p>That is it. Of course the protocol methods are like and other method and they can be passed parameters which what you need to do to pass data back which was your question in the first place. As a side note, see that I can pass data from Select to Edit without a protocol by creating properties in Edit and setting those properties in the prepareForSegue method of Select. Doing so gives me one shot to set some parameters when Edit is instantiated. My use of a the delegate protocol goes back to Select and has it pass another note (previous or next) to Edit. I hope that helps. You can see there are several steps to creating a delegate protocol. I numbered them 1-9. If the data is not making it back, I usually find I forgot one of the steps.</p>

So first of all, any <code>gm</code> function is likely not what you want to use, since you are missing timezone information from this "timestamp" to begin with, hence conversion to GM time is ambiguous if not impossible.</p> <p>The best you may be able to do is:</p> <pre><code>$timestamp = DateTime::createFromFormat('His', sprintf('%06d', 160000))-&gt;format('U'); echo strftime('%H:%M', $timestamp); </code></pre>

5450555	0	 <p>I assume that you meant to return the <code>list</code> local variable that you declare in the <code>returnLists</code> function. What you'll be getting back is actually the class variable, also called <code>list</code>. This is because the local <code>list</code> variable has gone out of context by the time the code reaches your return statement (the local <code>list</code> variable is within the context of the <code>try</code> block you have declared). If you want to return the value from the local <code>list</code> variable change the first couple of lines of <code>returnLists</code> to this:</p> <pre><code>public List returnLists(String fileN) { mp3Lister woww = null; String fName; String lName; mp3Lister qwewq; List list = new LinkedList(); try { </code></pre> <p>and then remove the declaration of the <code>list</code> variable inside the try block.</p>

28843910	0	 <p>Basically, in mathematics, there is a concept of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_measure" rel="nofollow">Lebesgue Measure</a>". This assigns values to length, area, volume, etc. by manipulating the interval <code>[0,1]</code>.</p> <p>Here's an intituitive explanation. A point at <code>x</code> can be represented as a limiting case of the interval <code>[x,x+h]</code> as <code>h</code> approaches <code>0</code>. The measure of the point, <code>(x+h) - x = h</code> as <code>h</code> approaches <code>0</code> is therefore <code>0</code>.</p> <p>However, if we take a line segment--say, <code>[0,1]</code>--and decompose it into <code>n</code> intervals <code>I[k]</code> with <code>k</code> being over the integers from <code>0</code> to <code>n-1</code>, each will take the form <code>I[k] = [k/n, k/n + 1/n)]</code>. If we let <code>n</code> go to infinity, each of the <code>I[k]</code> can be modeled as a point because <code>1/n</code> is approaching <code>0</code>. If we take the measure of each point, we get <code>1/n</code> as <code>n</code> approaches infinity, or zero. On the other hand, if we sum the measures of the points, we get <code>1/n * n = 1</code>, the measure of <code>[0,1]</code>.</p>

4309378	0	Association Extensions no longer working in Rails 2.3.10 <p>I have an app that we just upgrade from 2.1.0 to 2.3.10. After the upgrade, an Association Extension that previously worked causes a failure. Here is the code on the model for the extension:</p> <pre><code>Class Classroom has_many :registrations has_many :students, :through =&gt; :registrations, :uniq =&gt; true do def in_group(a_group) if a_driver scoped(:conditions =&gt; ['registrations.group_id = ?', a_group]) else in_no_group end end def in_no_group scoped(:conditions =&gt; 'registrations.group_id is null') end end end </code></pre> <p>This is a simplified model of my actual issue, but basically I used to be able to do</p> <pre><code>classroom.students.in_group(honor_students) </code></pre> <p>This no longer works, with the following output: </p> <pre><code>classroom.students.in_group(honor_students) ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: Mysql::Error: Unknown column 'registrations.group_id' in 'where clause': SELECT * FROM `students` WHERE (registrations.group_id = 1234) </code></pre> <p>When I just grab the list of students, the SQL has all the expected join syntax there thats missing from the above version:</p> <pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT `students`.* FROM `students` INNER JOIN `registrations` ON `students`.id = `registrations`.student_id WHERE ((`registrations`.classroom_id = 9876)) </code></pre> <p>Why is the association extension missing all the join SQL?</p>

10707169	0	 <p>I had this exact problem today, while making a sample project for another SO answer! It looks like your xib is trying to connect an outlet to your view controller instead of your cell. In your screenshot, the outlets look correctly defined, but occasionally an old outlet definition can get left in the underlying XML and cause this type of crash. </p> <p>If you've changed the files owner class after connecting some outlets, for example, this could confuse it. </p> <p>You may be able to find it by opening the xib as "source code", look for the element and check there are only the entries you expect. Perhaps search the XML file for <code>albumLabel</code> as well. </p> <p>If that doesn't work, you may have to scrap the xib and start again. </p>

They can both be seen from the beginning of the script output (from echo statements). The script output is:</p> <p>show_namefirst_intital1HELLOtestuser1Array</p> <p>Problem 1: As you can see, the script prints a 1 which means that it is entering the case titled "show_name" of the switch on $key. However, it does not enter the case entitled "first_intial" of the switch on $value. Why is this?</p> <p>Problem 2: Anyway the script enters the default case of the switch on $value and prints HELLO. Then, it prints the $update_val which is the testuser1. However, that value is not getting assigned to the user_meta because it is printing "Array". Why is this?</p> <p>Thanks in advance.

I'm working on migrating an internal system to Django and have run into a few wrinkles.</p> <p><b>Intro</b><br> Our current system (a billing system) tracks double-entry bookkeeping while allowing users to enter data as invoices, expenses, etc.</p> <p><b>Base Objects</b><br> So I have two base objects/models:</p> <ul><li>JournalEntry <li>JournalEntryItems </ul> <p>defined as follows:</p> <pre> class JournalEntry(models.Model): gjID = models.AutoField(primary_key=True) date = models.DateTimeField('entry date'); memo = models.CharField(max_length=100); class JournalEntryItem(models.Model): journalEntryID = models.AutoField(primary_key=True) gjID = models.ForeignKey(JournalEntry, db_column='gjID') amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10,decimal_places=2) </pre> <p>So far, so good. It works quite smoothly on the admin side (inlines work, etc.)</p> <p><b>On to the next section.</b><br> We then have two more models</p> <ul><li>InvoiceEntry <li>InvoiceEntryItem </ul> <p>An InvoiceEntry is a superset of / it inherits from JournalEntry, so I've been using a OneToOneField (which is what we're using in the background on our current site). That works quite smoothly too.</p> <pre> class InvoiceEntry(JournalEntry): invoiceID = models.AutoField(primary_key=True, db_column='invoiceID', verbose_name='') journalEntry = models.OneToOneField(JournalEntry, parent_link=True, db_column='gjID') client = models.ForeignKey(Client, db_column='clientID') datePaid = models.DateTimeField(null=True, db_column='datePaid', blank=True, verbose_name='date paid') </pre> <p>Where I run into problems is when trying to add an InvoiceEntryItem (which inherits from JournalEntryItem) to an inline related to InvoiceEntry. I'm getting the error:</p> <pre> &lt;class 'billing.models.InvoiceEntryItem'&gt; has more than 1 ForeignKey to &lt;class 'billing.models.InvoiceEntry'&gt; </pre> <p>The way I see it, InvoiceEntryItem has a ForeignKey directly to InvoiceEntry. And it also has an indirect ForeignKey to InvoiceEntry through the JournalEntry 1->M JournalEntryItems relationship.</p> <p>Here's the code I'm using at the moment.</p> <pre> class InvoiceEntryItem(JournalEntryItem): invoiceEntryID = models.AutoField(primary_key=True, db_column='invoiceEntryID', verbose_name='') invoiceEntry = models.ForeignKey(InvoiceEntry, related_name='invoiceEntries', db_column='invoiceID') journalEntryItem = models.OneToOneField(JournalEntryItem, db_column='journalEntryID') </pre> <ol> <li><p>I've tried removing the journalEntryItem OneToOneField. Doing that then removes my ability to retrieve the dollar amount for this particular InvoiceEntryItem (which is only stored in journalEntryItem).</p></li> <li><p>I've also tried removing the invoiceEntry ForeignKey relationship. Doing that removes the relationship that allows me to see the InvoiceEntry 1->M InvoiceEntryItems in the admin inline. All I see are blank fields (instead of the actual data that is currently stored in the DB).</p></li> </ol> <p>It seems like option 2 is closer to what I want to do. But my inexperience with Django seems to be limiting me. I might be able to filter the larger pool of journal entries to see just invoice entries. But it would be really handy to think of these solely as invoices (instead of a subset of journal entries).</p> <p>Any thoughts on how to do what I'm after?</p>

35821756	0	 <p>Your checkout failed because pulling (and hence fetching) an explicit ref fetches <em>only</em> that ref, so after your initial pull your repo had only <code>refs/heads/master</code> and <code>refs/remotes/origin/master</code>, both pointing at the same commit. Checkout of 2.7 didn't work because your repo didn't have anything by that name.</p> <p>Pull does a merge, and the extra content <code>git pull origin 2.7</code> put in your worktree is there for conflict resolution, merge can't determine the correct results so you have to. You'll see that not everything outside the Tools directory is checked out, only the conflicted files. I'm not sure how merge with a shallow fetch and sparse checkout should behave overall, but asking for conflict resolution is surely the only thing to do here.</p> <p>Doing a shallow one-ref fetch is as lightweight as git gets, if one-off bandwidth use is really that dear you could clone to an ec2 instance and tag a particular tree.</p>

32739558	0	Media Foundation EVR no video displaying <p>I've been trying in vain to come up with a no frills example of displaying video using Microsoft's Media Foundation Enhanced Video Renderer (EVR). I'm testing on Windows 7 with Visual Studio 2013.</p> <p>I'm pretty sure I've got the media types configured correctly as I can export and save the buffer from the IMFSample in my read loop to a bitmap. I can also get the video to render IF I get MF to automatically generate the topology but in this case I need to wire up the source reader and sink writer manually so I can get access to the different parts of the pipeline.</p> <p>I have used mftrace to see if I can spot anything different between the automatically generated topology and the manually wired up example but nothing obvious jumps out.</p> <p>The code is below (full sample project at <a href="https://github.com/sipsorcery/mediafoundationsamples/tree/master/MFVideoEVR" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/sipsorcery/mediafoundationsamples/tree/master/MFVideoEVR</a>).</p> <p>Is there a step I've missed to get the IMFSample from the SinkWriter to display on the video window?

This means that instead of creating a new thread, an available thread is picked from the pool and returned there when the method finishes.</p> <p>The number of threads in the pool varies with the version of .NET and the OS, the number of cores etc. It can go from 25 threads per core in .NET 4 to hundreds or per core in .NET 4.5 on a server OS.</p> <p>An additional optimization for IO-bound (disk, network) tasks is that instead of using a thread, an IO completion port is used. Roughly, this is a callback from the IO stack when an IO operation (disk or network) finishes. This way the framework doesn't waste a thread waiting for an IO call to finish.</p> <p>When you start an asynchronous network operation, .NET make the network call, registers for the callback and releases the threadpool thread. When the call finishes, the framework gets notified and schedules the rest of the asynchronous method (essentially what comes after the <code>await</code> or <code>ContinueWith</code>) on a threadpool thread. </p> <p>Submitting a 100 asynchronous operations doesn't mean that 100 threads will be used nor that all 100 of them will execute in parallel. Rather, the framework will take into account the number of cores, the load and the number of available threads to execute as many of them as possible, without hurting overall performance. Waiting on the network calls may not even use a thread at all, while processing the messages themselves will execute on threadpool threads</p>

11372554	0	 <p>One important thing: you should write <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript" rel="nofollow">unobtrusive JavaScript</a>, as it is considered best practice. With it, you can maintain a separation of content from code. Thus, the first step is to remove that <code>onclick</code> handler on the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element.</p> <p>I'm assuming you want to click the button that says "click for hide" to hide the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. Okay, so let's get some skeleton code out into the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>:</p> <pre><code>$(document).ready(function() { $(&lt;button&gt;).click(function() { $(&lt;div&gt;).hide(); }); }); </code></pre> <p>But we need to somehow link that <code>click</code> handler to that button, and link that <code>hide</code> function to the actual <code>div</code>. Here's the easiest way to do this: give your <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> some ids. Let's say...</p> <pre><code>&lt;button id="hide-button"&gt;...&lt;/button&gt; &lt;div id="hide-div"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre> <p>Now, we simply need to make a few modifications to our skeleton code:</p> <pre><code>$("#hide-button").click(function() { $("#hide-div").hide(); }); </code></pre> <p>Here's what this simple code does. When your DOM loads, a nameless function (you can't name functions that you define on the fly*) is invoked from the document's ready event. This nameless function attaches the <code>click</code> handler to your <code>#hide-button</code> button, so that when you click the button, another anonymous function is invoked. That function calls <code>hide</code>, which does some jQuery magic that works in all browsers, on that <code>#hide-div</code> div to hide it.</p> <p>*Well, you can, but only if you define them first and then pass them. Like this:</p> <pre><code>var fn = function() {...}; $(document).ready(fn); </code></pre> <p><strong>Edit</strong></p> <p>Since the asker does not want to use IDs or classes, here's an alternative solution:</p> <pre><code>&lt;script&gt; function hide() { $('div').hide(); } &lt;/script&gt; ... &lt;button onclick="hide()"&gt;click for hide&lt;/button&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre> <p>Be careful not to place <code>function hide()</code> within jQuery's document-ready idiom. Doing so will deny you access to <code>hide()</code> because of scoping.</p>

Your host system D: is not the issue, but for some reason the system.img file that represents a NAND flash for the emulator is full.

You need the name for the second command. The emulator should not already be running. A third option would be to delete the disk images located under your Windows profile. Under your profiles, it's <code>.android/avd/My_Avd_Name.avd</code> You should only need to delete <code>userdata-qemu.img</code> and maybe <code>cache.img</code>. You can try deleting other image files if necessarily, but note, <code>sdcard.img</code> won't be re-created automatically. You need to run <code>mksdcard</code> from the command-line.</p>

14368605	0	 <p>Unless there is some other requirement not specified, I would simply convert your color image to grayscale and work with that only (no need to work on the 3 channels, the contrast present is too high already). Also, unless there is some specific problem regarding resizing, I would work with a downscaled version of your images, since they are relatively large and the size adds nothing to the problem being solved. Then, finally, your problem is solved with a median filter, some basic morphological tools, and statistics (mostly for the Otsu thresholding, which is already done for you).</p> <p>Here is what I obtain with your sample image and some other image with a sheet of paper I found around:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E5AZAm.png" alt="enter image description here"> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vplgsm.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>The median filter is used to remove minor details from the, now grayscale, image. It will possibly remove thin lines inside the whitish paper, which is good because then you will end with tiny connected components which are easy to discard. After the median, apply a morphological gradient (simply <code>dilation</code> - <code>erosion</code>) and binarize the result by Otsu. The morphological gradient is a good method to keep strong edges, it should be used more. Then, since this gradient will increase the contour width, apply a morphological thinning. Now you can discard small components.</p> <p>At this point, here is what we have with the right image above (before drawing the blue polygon), the left one is not shown because the only remaining component is the one describing the paper:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/isxDQ.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>Given the examples, now the only issue left is distinguishing between components that look like rectangles and others that do not. This is a matter of determining a ratio between the area of the convex hull containing the shape and the area of its bounding box; the ratio 0.7 works fine for these examples. It might be the case that you also need to discard components that are inside the paper, but not in these examples by using this method (nevertheless, doing this step should be very easy especially because it can be done through OpenCV directly).</p> <p>For reference, here is a sample code in Mathematica:</p> <pre><code>f = Import["http://thwartedglamour.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/my-coffee-table-1-sa.jpg"] f = ImageResize[f, ImageDimensions[f][[1]]/4] g = MedianFilter[ColorConvert[f, "Grayscale"], 2] h = DeleteSmallComponents[Thinning[ Binarize[ImageSubtract[Dilation[g, 1], Erosion[g, 1]]]]] convexvert = ComponentMeasurements[SelectComponents[ h, {"ConvexArea", "BoundingBoxArea"}, #1 / #2 &gt; 0.7 &amp;], "ConvexVertices"][[All, 2]] (* To visualize the blue polygons above: *) Show[f, Graphics[{EdgeForm[{Blue, Thick}], RGBColor[0, 0, 1, 0.5], Polygon @@ convexvert}]] </code></pre> <p>If there are more varied situations where the paper's rectangle is not so well defined, or the approach confuses it with other shapes -- these situations could happen due to various reasons, but a common cause is bad image acquisition -- then try combining the pre-processing steps with the work described in the paper "Rectangle Detection based on a Windowed Hough Transform".</p>

20081748	0	Drawing layers with jcanvas: performance optimization <p>)</p> <p>I have a small web-application which uses jquery and jcanvas (<a href="http://calebevans.me/projects/jcanvas/" rel="nofollow">http://calebevans.me/projects/jcanvas/</a>) to print some shapes onto a canvas.</p> <p>It's basically a map. The user can zoom into it and drag it around and whenever he does so everything has to be drawn again.</p> <p>As you may see in the code below I remove and recreate layers pretty often (whenever the user drags the map, zooms or resizes his window). I need the layers to handle hover- and click-events. My question is whether there is a big performance impact of this way to handle events in comparison to other solutions. If this is the case, how could I optimize my performance?</p> <pre><code>var posX = 0, posY = 0; var zoom = 100; var points = []; //array of up to 1000 points retrieved by ajax function draw(){ $("canvas").removeLayers(); $("canvas").clearCanvas(); var xp, yp, ra; var name; $.each(points, function(index) { xp = (this["x"]-posX)/zoom; yp = (this["y"]-posY)/zoom; ra = 1000/zoom; $("#map").drawArc({ layer:true, fillStyle: "black", x: xp, y: yp, radius: ra, mouseover: function(layer) { $(this).animateLayer(layer, { fillStyle: "#c33", scale: 1.0 },200); }, mouseout: function(layer) { $(this).animateLayer(layer, { fillStyle: "black", scale: 1.0 },200); }, mouseup: function(layer){ context(index,layer.x,layer.y); } }); }); } </code></pre> <p>Thank you for your time :-)</p>

However, from what I've read, you can get a performance boost up front by disabling iterator debugging/checking:</p> <pre><code>#define _HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING 0 #define _SECURE_SCL 0 </code></pre> <p>Other things that can affect debug performance are excessive calls to new and delete. Memory pools can help with that. You haven't provided details for <code>PropMsg::add_v_var_repeated()</code> or <code>PropMsg::~PropMsg()</code>, so I can't comment.

7861459	0	 <p>Responding to dvcolgan's clarifying comment:</p> <p>So, you want to have an HTML file on the server with inline CoffeeScript that gets served as HTML with inline JavaScript. The CoffeeScript compiler doesn't support this directly, but you could write a Node script to do it fairly easily, using the <code>coffee-script</code> library and <a href="https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom">jsdom</a> to do the HTML parsing.</p> <p>Exactly how you want to implement this would depend on the web framework you're using. You probably don't want the CoffeeScript compiler to run on every request (it's pretty fast, but it's still going to reduce the number of requests/second your server can handle); instead, you'd want to compile your HTML once and then serve the compiled version from a cache. Again, I don't know of any existing tools that do this, but it shouldn't be too hard to write your own.</p>

6303906	0	 <p>The answer is 1/4. Here is the explanation.</p> <p>Let x is the length of the leftmost stick and y is the length of the rightmost stick. Then the middle stick has length n-x-y, if the original stick's length was n.</p> <p>The possible values for x,y are those for which:</p> <ol> <li>x > 0</li> <li>y > 0</li> <li>x + y &lt; n</li> </ol> <p>In the plane Oxy this is equivalent to say that the point (x,y) lies within the triangle with vertices (0, 0), (n, 0), (0, n).</p> <p>Now these three numbers (x, y, n-x-y) form a triangle if all of the three are satisfied:</p> <ol> <li>x + y > n - x - y &lt;=> x + y &lt; n/2</li> <li>x + (n - x - y) > y &lt;=> y &lt; n/2</li> <li>y + (n - x - y) > x &lt;=> x &lt; n/2</li> </ol> <p>Again in the Oxy plane these are satisfied when the point (x,y) lies within the triangle with vertices (0, n/2), (n/2, n/2), (n/2, 0).</p> <p>The area of this triangle is a quarter of the area of the (0, 0), (n, 0), (0, n) triangle, since it's the 'middle' triangle (whose vertices are the midpoints) of the bigger one.</p> <p>Here is a simple C# program to verify the answer:</p> <pre><code>Random r = new Random(); int count = 0, total = 0, tries = 1000000; double x, y; for (int i = 0; i &lt; tries; i++) { x = r.NextDouble(); y = r.NextDouble(); if (x + y &gt; 0.5 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 0.5 &amp;&amp; y &lt; 0.5) ++count; if (x + y &lt; 1.0) ++total; } Console.WriteLine((double)count / total); </code></pre>

12213317	0	 <p>Some code would be useful. In the absence of that here's a best guess generic answer: In general terms you will need to work out how to map (convert) each format to the other. Then you can convert to the format suitable for the database before you save and convert from database format to google maps format when you retrieve. I imagine each polygon is a set of latitude/longitude pairs in both formats so it shouldn't be too difficult.</p> <p>Alternatively, since you're using JSON, you could just save the JSON to a text field in the database (or to a JSON field in the upcoming 9.2 release of PostgreSQL): </p> <p><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/datatype-json.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/datatype-json.html</a></p> <p>However if you would like to perform geographical queries in the database that would obviously limit your options.</p>

The MovieClips being added are called 'square' and when I left Mouse Click I add a series of these MovieClips to the stage. My problem is that I want to listen out for a hitTestObject of 'square' intercepting 'square' and subsequent additions of the same MovieClip.</p> <p>I've set up a numerical variable that increments up by 1 each time I add the group of 'square' MovieClips through left click to the stage and I've assigned this number along with a string to combine together to create a square.name instance.</p> <p>In my case the first group of MovieClips added would have a .name instance called 'Square 1' and then 'Square 2' on the second mouse click and so on.</p> <p>I've also added and pushed each name through into a container array for referencing later.</p> <p>So how can I actually reference these dynamic names in a hitTestObject argument using my .name instance and array??</p> <p>I'm sure it is obvious and I've done the groundwork so any help to point this out to me would be greatly appriciated.</p> <p>Many Thanks.</p>
30769109	0	 <p>If using uWSGI, there is a command line option which allows you to say you are providing it with a module path instead of a file path. For standard Apache with mod_wsgi, or with uWSGI defaults, you can create a WSGI script file which imports the WSGI application from your module by its path into the WSGI script file and then refer to that WSGI script file. If using mod_wsgi-express, then it has an option like uWSGI which allows you to say you are providing it with a module path instead.</p>

Yesterday, I started the app and I could see the map displayed and was able to pan around and zoom in and out. It worked perfectly. I also ran the app successfully on a Galaxy tab (I normally run them on an emulator). Today, I started the application, but instead of seeing the map, I see a grid of grey boxes. I thought it might be a problem with the API key, so I created a second one and swapped it with the first, this did not fix the problem.</p> <p>The only difference between the times I tried running the projects was that I did it on two different computers. It worked originally on the computer that I created the project on, but it now will no longer work on any computer that I have attempted to use. I don't know that this is related, but it is the only significant thing that changed between when I ran the project each time.</p> <p>After looking through the LogCat, I have found two errors that might be relevant to my problem they are:</p> <p>Could not open GPS configuration file /etc/gps.conf<br/> Couldn't get connection factory client</p> <p>Does anyone know if these are problems, and if so, how to fix them?</p>

But, before doing that, you want to change the date comparison:</p> <pre><code>where t1.Created &gt;= convert(datetime, @stringYYYYMMDD, 112) and t1.Created &lt; convert(datetime, @stringYYYYMMDD, 112) + 1 and t1.Term = @Label </code></pre> <p>Moving the function from the column to the constant makes the comparison "sargable", meaning that indexes can be used for it.</p> <p>Next, create the indexes <code>table1(Term, Created, Id)</code> and <code>table2(table1Id)</code>. These indexes should boost performance.</p>

Our understanding is that the Wire Tap component is InOnly and therefore will not capture the response. </p> <p>Our current thought is to push the audit requests to a Queue after the Wiretap. We would then take the requests off the queue and call the auditing endpoint logging the responses. </p> <p>Is this the best approach or is there a better way?</p> <p>Could we use "setExchangePattern" to make the Wire Tap InOut? If so would it block the main route?</p> <p>We have seen there is an OnCompletion handler but are not sure whether that would be of use to us. Again would it block the main route?</p>

11456688	0	Hibernate if @NotFound, Insert into Database <p>My client wrote the back-end for an application i'm building using PHP. However He didn't write the database all too well. For instance there is two tables one 'users' and one 'user_settings'. However his script would only create rows in 'user_settings' once a user decided to modify their settings. Otherwise his entire script used defaults, in his words "as an attempt to save database space".</p> <p>However, in Hibernate i'm having to try and get those 'user_settings' for some users and its causing problems for those that don't have any set. Is there a way in hibernate that I would be able to insert some default settings into the database, after a call to getClientSettings() if nothing exists in the database for that client?</p>

I'm using, among others, the delegate methods <code>tokenField(tokenField: NSTokenField, representedObjectForEditingString editingString: String) -&gt; AnyObject</code> and <code>tokenField(tokenField: NSTokenField, displayStringForRepresentedObject representedObject: AnyObject) -&gt; String?</code> to work with represented objects. My represented objects are instances of a custom class.</p> <p>From the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/TokenField_Guide/GetSetTokenFields/GetSetTokenFields.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006555-CH9-SW2" rel="nofollow">Apple Documentation</a>, I know that <code>objectValue</code> can be used to access the represented objects of a <code>NSTokenView</code> as a <code>NSArray</code>:</p> <blockquote> <p>To retrieve the objects represented by the tokens in a token field, send the token field an <code>objectValue</code> message. Although this method is declared by <code>NSControl</code>, <code>NSTokenField</code> implements it to return an array of represented objects. If the token field simply contains a series of strings, <code>objectValue</code> returns an array of strings. To set the represented objects of a token field, use the <code>setObjectValue</code>: method, passing in an array of represented objects. If these objects aren’t strings, <code>NSTokenField</code> then queries its delegate for the display strings to use for each token.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, this doesn't seem to work for me. <code>let tokenArray = self.tokenField.objectValue! as! NSArray</code> does return a NSArray, but it is empty, even though the delegate method required to return a represented object has been called the appropriate amount of times before.</p> <p><code>NSTokenView</code> doesn't seem like a particularly strong tool to work with tokenization, but, lacking an alternative, I hope that you guys can help me making my implementation work.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p>

13966226	0	Accept only number formats for a property from JSON <p>I am developing ASP.Net Web API application and we are exposing a REST API for different clients. I have a problem when taking users' JSON files and converting them to Data Model classes. My JSON looks like below.</p> <pre><code>{"engagementid":1,"clientname":"fsdfs","myno":"23,45","address1":"fsd","address2":"fsdfs","city":"fsdfs","zip":"fsdf","info":"fsdfs","country":"fsdfs","currency":"NOK"} </code></pre> <p>You can see that my "myno" is sent as a string. But in my Server Data Model "myno" is a double value. So what happen here is when I send the value for "myno" as "23,45", it gets assigned to MyNo property of my Model as 2345. This is wrong, because you can see that the number has been changed because of this wrong conversion. What I simply need is to restrict this conversion. I mean, I want to send an error to Client if he sends a string for "myno" property. Since it is a double value in my Server Data Model, I want to accept only numbers from the client for this property. Which means, I want it like this.</p> <pre><code>{"myno":2345} //correct {"myno":"2345"} //wrong. I want to send a error to user by saying, "We only accept Numbers for this value" </code></pre> <p>How do I do this?</p> <p>Update: This problem gets solved if I am using int in my server-model. I mean, if a client send a string to a property which is represented as int in my model, then it gives an error to user by saying string to int conversion can not be done.</p>
13648622	0	 <p>You will need to identify what makes that data unique in the table. If it's a customer table, then it's probably the customerid of 13029. However if it's a customer order table, then maybe it's the combination of CustomerId and OrderDate (and maybe not, I have placed two unique orders on the same date). You will know the answer to that based on your table's design.</p> <p>Armed with that knowledge, you will want to write a query to pull back the keys from the target table <code>SELECT CO.CustomerId, CO.OrderId FROM dbo.CustomerOrder CO</code> If you know the process only transfers data from the current year, add a filter to the above query to restrict the number of rows returned. The reason for this is memory conservation-you want SSIS to run fast, don't bring back extraneous columns or rows it will never need.</p> <p>Inside your dataflow, add a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms141821.aspx" rel="nofollow">Lookup Transformation</a> with that query. You don't specify 2005, 2008 or 2012 as your SSIS version and they have different behaviours associated with the Lookup Transformation. Generally speaking, what you are looking to do is identify the unmatched rows. By definition, unmatched means they don't exist in the target database so those are the rows that are <em>new</em>. 2005 assumes every row is going to match or it errors. You will need to click the Configure Error Output... button and select "Redirect Rows". 2008+ has an option under "Specify how to handle rows with no matching entries" and there you'll want "Redirect rows to no match output."</p> <p>Now take the No match output branch (2008+) or the error output branch (2005) and plumb that into your destination.</p> <p>What this approach doesn't cover is detecting and handling when the source system reports $56.82 and the target system has $22.38 (updates). If you need to handle that, then you need to look at some change detection system. Look at Andy Leonard's <a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/Stairway+Series/76390/" rel="nofollow">Stairway to Integration Services</a> series of articles to learn about options for detecting and handling changes.</p>

Make sure that you implement unique index for the sorting column so that it could enhance your db as well as application performance.</p> <p>To make your sorting a lot easier in .NET, you can use the classes in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.specialized.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">System.Collections.Specialized Namespace</a> to sort your lists and want it for strongly-typed collections, i.e. Dictionary, OrderedDictionary, etc. because you will be using a key/value pair if you are implementing a sort order column.</p> <p>Hope this helps!</p>

38064565	0	App crashes on sendText method <p>I am developing my first android app where someone can send multiple sms to a designated number. The app used to run fine when I had the number and number of messages to be sent already programmed into the code. However, I created a separate activity where one can input the destination number and number of messages to be sent, and transfer that data back to the first activity through an intent. But now the app crashes upon attempting to send a message.</p> <p>Here is the first activity: </p> <pre><code>public class TextMessages extends AppCompatActivity { public static final String DEFAULT = "No Number Found"; private EditText customMessage; String gotNum; FloatingActionButton button; int request_code; String realnum; int temp; int recode; Button butt; int number; String num; String text; int x; @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.activity_text_messages); request_code = 1; FloatingActionButton button = (FloatingActionButton) findViewById(R.id.but); assert button != null; button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { Intent intent = new Intent(TextMessages.this,Settings.class); startActivityForResult(intent, request_code); Intent a = new Intent(TextMessages.this,Settings.class); startActivityForResult(a, recode); } }); customMessage = (EditText)findViewById(R.id.customMessage); } public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data){ if (requestCode== request_code){ if (resultCode== Activity.RESULT_OK){ num = data.getStringExtra("value"); text = data.getStringExtra("cost"); } } } public void sendText(View view) { String message = ""; if (view.getId() == R.id.fab) { message = customMessage.getText().toString(); } else { Button sender = (Button)view; message = sender.getText().toString(); } //Toast.makeText(this, "Test", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); int i; x = Integer.parseInt(text); for (i = 0; i &lt; x; i++){ SmsManager smsManager = SmsManager.getDefault(); smsManager.sendTextMessage(num, null, message, null, null); } }} </code></pre> <p>As you can see I have replaced the predetermined number with String num and the number of messages to be sent with int x, which causes the app to crash when the button to send the messages is pressed.</p> <p>Here is the activity where the number and messages to be sent is collected from:</p> <pre><code>public class Settings extends AppCompatActivity { public EditText phoneNum; public Button apply; public EditText msgCounter; public Button save; int msgCount; @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.activity_settings); phoneNum = (EditText)findViewById(R.id.phoneNum); msgCounter = (EditText)findViewById(R.id.msgCount); apply = (Button)findViewById(R.id.butto); save = (Button)findViewById(R.id.butt); save.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { Intent pass = new Intent(); pass.putExtra("value", phoneNum.getText().toString()); pass.putExtra("cost",msgCounter.getText().toString()); setResult(Activity.RESULT_OK,pass); finish(); } }); } public void OnButtonClickedApply(View view) { String num; num = phoneNum.getText().toString(); //Toast.makeText(this, num, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); } public void saveMsg(View view) { msgCount = Integer.parseInt(msgCounter.getText().toString()); } } </code></pre> <p>Also I may add, when inputting data into the second activity. Upon pressing the button to save the data, the activity resets(reloads?) and I have to put the data in a second time, when pressing the button will then take me back to the first activity like it should.</p> <p>Crash Log: </p> <pre><code>06-27 19:14:55.583 2404-2404/com.linfirmware.emergencytext E/AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: main Process: com.linfirmware.emergencytext, PID: 2404 java.lang.IllegalStateException: Could not execute method for android:onClick at android.support.v7.app.AppCompatViewInflater$DeclaredOnClickListener.onClick(AppCompatViewInflater.java:293) at android.view.View.performClick(View.java:5198) at android.view.View$PerformClick.run(View.java:21147) at android.os.Handler.handleCallback(Handler.java:739) at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:95) at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:148) at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:5417) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method) at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:726) at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:616) Caused by: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method) at android.support.v7.app.AppCompatViewInflater$DeclaredOnClickListener.onClick(AppCompatViewInflater.java:288) at android.view.View.performClick(View.java:5198) at android.view.View$PerformClick.run(View.java:21147) at android.os.Handler.handleCallback(Handler.java:739) at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:95) at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:148) at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:5417) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method) at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:726) at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:616) Caused by: java.lang.SecurityException: Sending SMS message: uid 10057 does not have android.permission.SEND_SMS. at android.os.Parcel.readException(Parcel.java:1599) at android.os.Parcel.readException(Parcel.java:1552) at com.android.internal.telephony.ISms$Stub$Proxy.sendTextForSubscriber(ISms.java:768) at android.telephony.SmsManager.sendTextMessageInternal(SmsManager.java:310) at android.telephony.SmsManager.sendTextMessage(SmsManager.java:293) at com.example.rahul.customtext.TextMessages.sendText(TextMessages.java:94) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method) at android.support.v7.app.AppCompatViewInflater$DeclaredOnClickListener.onClick(AppCompatViewInflater.java:288) at android.view.View.performClick(View.java:5198) at android.view.View$PerformClick.run(View.java:21147) at android.os.Handler.handleCallback(Handler.java:739) at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:95) at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:148) at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:5417) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method) at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:726) at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:616) 06-27 19:14:57.765 2404-2404/com.linfirmware.emergencytext I/Process: Sending signal.

28110474	0	Should I add publish_actions for review after migrating old app to Graph API v2.2? <p>I've been updating few web apps to the latest Facebook Graph API - v2.2. Those sites work and some of them have opengraph action video.watches ("Watch"). It's approved and works.</p> <p>Recently I got a generic Facebook email that one or more of my apps are using permissions that have to be reviewed or they will stop working on some date. As those apps are quite old they don't have publish_actions in the review set (and that's the only extra permission in that video.watches websites). So now - does Facebook wants that publish_actions to be added to the review or it's something else (they could be more specific)?</p>

This is for a competition and putting in Not_An_SMS returns notAnSms instead of notAnSMS? Also putting in num2words is supposed to return the same but instead my program capitalizes it like num2Words.

11560960	0	 <p>There are a lot of workarounds provided in other answers; they more or less solve your problem. One more workaround:</p> <pre><code>foreach (string name in a.Keys){ StackPanel SP = new StackPanel(); TextBox TB1 = new TextBox(); TextBox TB2 = new TextBox(); SP.Children.Add(TB1); SP.Children.Add(TB2); // ... Content to TextBoxes TB2.Name = name; MainCheckBox.Clicked += (sender, e) =&gt; { TB2.Height = MainCheckBox.IsChecked ? 300 : 0; } } </code></pre> <p>But let's see what should be the correct way.</p> <p>First of all, you need the data items to be presented in a bindable form. This means either derive from <code>DependencyObject</code> or implement <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code>. Second, you need to put your objects into an <code>ObservableCollection</code>. Then, you can use different containers like <code>ListView</code> or <code>ListBox</code> for displaying the collection of data. For the type representing the data item, you'd need to create a <code>DataTemplate</code>, in which you can put any custom logic you need.</p> <p>You see that this is quite a lot of work, so I wouldn't recommend this approach for really small applications; however as your application grows, this approach will show its benefits.</p>

41051163	0	 <p>Your best bet will be to learn Objective-C. It's not difficult to pick up, especially if you already have a strong understanding of C. (It's a much smaller and simpler extension of C than C++, for instance.)</p> <p>Your options other than that are quite limited:</p> <ul> <li><p>There's Carbon, Apple's legacy C framework for UI development. <strong>Using it is not recommended</strong>. Carbon was never updated to support 64-bit applications, and lacks many features that have been added to Cocoa since the 64-bit transition (~2005). It's also very awkward to write an application in, as it was designed in large part to ease porting of applications written for Classic Mac OS.</p></li> <li><p>There's also X11, with an appropriate UI library like GTK. <strong>I wouldn't recommend this either</strong>. Neither X11 nor any UI libraries for it are installed by default -- they must be installed by the user -- and applications which use X11 have a significantly different interface from native applications.</p></li> <li><p>A third-party UI library. Most of the ones I can think of offhand (QT, wxWidgets, and FLTK) require C++, though. <a href="https://www.gtk.org/download/macos.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GTK+</a> does have a C interface and natively supports a macOS interface, but it's not particularly native.</p></li> <li><p>A library specific to your use case. Impossible to recommend one without knowing more about what you're trying to do.</p></li> <li><p>Nothing. That's right, nothing at all. If you just need to let the user view an image, you can save it to a file and use the <code>open</code> command-line tool to open it in the Preview application. It's janky, but it's also really easy.</p></li> </ul>

I kind of got thrown into the deep end with Java and ANTLR back in June, so I definitely have some knowledge gaps.</p> <p>I've gotten to the point where I'm comfortable writing methods for my custom listener, and I want to be able to pretty-print the comments as well. My comments are on a separate hidden channel. Here are the grammar rules for the hidden tokens:</p> <pre><code>/* Comments and whitespace -- Nested comments are allowed, each is redirected to a specific channel */ COMMENT_1 : '(*' (COMMENT_1|COMMENT_2|.)*?

23698601	0	 <p>First of all, Console.WriteLine(" " + d1.n); will give you DVD:DVD because base means use the parent class' constructor. So, when you send your parameters into your D class, it is sending your code to your M class, it is executing it which gives you "DVD" on your screen and then it is changing the value of n. After that you are sending the "Unknown" value your M class directly which is not related with your D class anymore and it is showing you "Unknown" on your screen. At the end you are requesting D class' n value which is already "DVD". So the result is DVD Unknown DVD:DVD. I hope this makes sense for you.</p>

6341566	0	 <p>The terminology is a bit confusing indeed, but both <code>javax.net.ssl.keyStore</code> and <code>javax.net.ssl.trustStore</code> are used to specify which keystores to use, for two different purposes. Keystores come in various formats and are not even necessarily files (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6157550/question-on-java-keystores/6157716#6157716">this question</a>), and <code>keytool</code> is just a tool to perform various operations on them (import/export/list/...).</p> <p>The <code>javax.net.ssl.keyStore</code> and <code>javax.net.ssl.trustStore</code> parameters are the default parameters used to build <code>KeyManager</code>s and <code>TrustManager</code>s (respectively), then used to build an <code>SSLContext</code> which essentially contains the SSL/TLS settings to use when making an SSL/TLS connection via an <code>SSLSocketFactory</code> or an <code>SSLEngine</code>. These system properties are just where the default values come from, which is then used by <code>SSLContext.getDefault()</code>, itself used by <code>SSLSocketFactory.getDefault()</code> for example. (All of this can be customized via the API in a number of places, if you don't want to use the default values and that specific <code>SSLContext</code>s for a given purpose.)</p> <p>The difference between the <code>KeyManager</code> and <code>TrustManager</code> (and thus between <code>javax.net.ssl.keyStore</code> and <code>javax.net.ssl.trustStore</code>) is as follows (quoted from the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#RelsTM_KM">JSSE ref guide</a>):</p> <blockquote> <p>TrustManager: Determines whether the remote authentication credentials (and thus the connection) should be trusted.</p> <p>KeyManager: Determines which authentication credentials to send to the remote host.</p> </blockquote> <p>(Other parameters are available and their default values are described in the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#Customization">JSSE ref guide</a>. Note that while there is a default value for the trust store, there isn't one for the key store.)</p> <p>Essentially, the keystore in <code>javax.net.ssl.keyStore</code> is meant to contain your private keys and certificates, whereas the <code>javax.net.ssl.trustStore</code> is meant to contain the CA certificates you're willing to trust when a remote party presents its certificate. In some cases, they can be one and the same store, although it's often better practice to use distinct stores (especially when they're file-based).</p>

8378988	0	 <p>You can use UDP to multiple servers with the same socket. Probably the simplest way to do it is to have the client assign a session ID to each connection, include the session ID in each datagram it sends, and have the server return that session ID in each reply datagram it sends. Don't use the IP address to distinguish which server the packet is from because a server can have more than one IP address, making it unreliable.</p> <p>Just remember that if you use UDP, you don't get any of the things TCP adds. If you need any of them, you need to do them yourself. If you need all or most of them, TCP is a <em>much</em> better choice. TCP does:</p> <ul> <li><p>Session establishment</p></li> <li><p>Session teardown</p></li> <li><p>Retransmissions</p></li> <li><p>Transmit pacing</p></li> <li><p>Backoff and retry</p></li> <li><p>Out of order detection and rearrangement</p></li> <li><p>Sliding windows</p></li> <li><p>Acknowledgments</p></li> </ul> <p>If you need any of these things and choose to use UDP, you need to do them yourself.</p>

48508	0	 <p>I can only once again point to <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/new_learning.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Stroustrup</a> and preach: Don't teach the C subset! It's important, but not for beginners! C++ is complex enough as it is and the standard library classes, especially the STL, is much more important and (at least superficially) easier to understand than the C subset of C++.</p> <p>Same goes for pointers and heap memory allocation, incidentally. Of course they're important but only after having taught the STL containers.</p> <p>Another important concept that new students have to get their head around is the concept of different compilation units, the One Definition Rule (because if you don't know it you won't be able to decypher error messages) and headers. This is actually quite a barrier and one that has to be breached early on.</p> <p>Apart from the language features the most important thing to be taught is how to understand the C++ compiler and how to get help. Getting help (i.e. knowing how to search for the right information) in my experience is the single most important thing that has to be taught about C++.</p> <p>I've had quite good experiences with this order of teaching in the past.</p> <p>/EDIT: If you happen to know any German, take a look at <a href="http://madrat.net/coding/cpp/skript" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://madrat.net/coding/cpp/skript</a>, part of a <em>very</em> short introduction used in one of my courses.</p>

It often corrects itself after another zoom. </p> <p>Here's the relevant code. <code>updatedRects</code> is for testing -- it stores the unique rectangles requested to be drawn by <code>-drawLayer</code>. </p> <p>CanvasView.h: </p> <pre><code>@interface CanvasView : UIView @property (nonatomic, retain) NSMutableSet *updatedRects; @end </code></pre> <p>CanvasView.m: </p> <pre><code>@implementation CanvasView @synthesize updatedRects; + (Class)layerClass { return [CATiledLayer class]; } - (void)drawLayer:(CALayer *)layer inContext:(CGContextRef)context { CGRect rect = CGContextGetClipBoundingBox(context); [updatedRects addObject:[NSValue valueWithCGRect:rect]]; CGContextSaveGState(context); CGContextTranslateCTM(context, rect.origin.x, rect.origin.y); // ...draw into context... CGContextRestoreGState(context); } @end </code></pre> <p>MyViewController.m: </p> <pre><code>@implementation MyViewController - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; canvasView.updatedRects = [NSMutableSet set]; } - (void)scrollViewDidEndZooming:(UIScrollView *)scrollView withView:(UIView *)view atScale:(float)scale { canvasView.transform = CGAffineTransformIdentity; canvasView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, canvasView.frame.size.width * scale, canvasView.frame.size.height); [self updateCanvas]; } - (void)updateCanvas { NSLog(@"# rects updated: %d", [canvasView.updatedRects count]); [canvasView.updatedRects removeAllObjects]; canvasView.frame = CGRectMake(canvasView.frame.origin.x, canvasView.frame.origin.y, canvasView.frame.size.width, myHeight); CGFloat tileSize = 256; NSLog(@"next # rects updated will be: %f", [canvasView.layer bounds].size.width / tileSize); [canvasView.layer setNeedsDisplay]; } @end </code></pre> <p>When testing this, I always scrolled all the way across the view after zooming to make sure every tile was seen. Whenever the view looked wrong, the predicted "next # of rects updated" was greater than the actual "# of rects updated" on the next call to <code>-updateCanvas</code>. What would cause this? </p> <p><strong>Edit:</strong> </p> <p>Here's a better way to visualize the problem. Each time <code>updateCanvas</code> is called, I've made it change the background color for drawing tiles and record the time it was called -- the color and time are stored in <code>canvasView</code>. On each tile is drawn the tile's rectangle, the tile's index along the x axis, the time (sec.) when the background color was set, and the time (sec.) when the tile was drawn. If everything is working correctly, all tiles should be the same color. Instead, here's what I'm sometimes seeing: </p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k2BjY.png" alt="Screenshot of tiles with mismatched colors"> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6GzNS.png" alt="Screenshot of tiles with mismatched colors"></p> <p>I only seem to see wrong results after zooming out. <strike>The problem might be related to the fact that <code>scrollViewDidEndZooming</code>, and therefore <code>updateCanvas</code>, can get called multiple times per zoom-out.</strike> (<strong>Edit</strong>: No-- not called multiple times.) </p>

I already made the KeyListeners, and that they only get activated when you press/release the spacebar.</p> <p>What I tried so far:</p> <p>I tried creating a stopwatch class, which SHOULD calculate the time difference between me pressing space for the first time, and second time. I tried it as follows:</p> <pre><code> public class Stopwatch { public Stopwatch(int i) { long time = System.currentTimeMillis(); if(i%2==1){ System.out.println("Timer Started at: " + time); }else{ System.out.println("Timer stopped at: " + System.currentTimeMillis()); System.out.println("Time diff: " + (time - System.currentTimeMillis())); } }} </code></pre> <p><code>int i</code> increases with every second spacebar press.</p> <p>I know the problem here is that everytime I start this class, <code>time</code> is getting reset to System.currentTimeMillis() because I only press Spacebar. Thus the difference is always 0.</p> <p>How can I change this so that I can somehow save the time I first pressed space?</p> <p>Here is the class with the Keylisteners. Ignore the Scrambler class, it has nothing to do with my Problem.</p> <pre><code> import java.awt.Font; import java.awt.event.ActionEvent; import java.awt.event.ActionListener; import java.awt.event.KeyEvent; import java.awt.event.KeyListener; import javax.swing.*; public class StoppuhrFrame extends JFrame { JLabel time, scramble; public StoppuhrFrame() { time = new JLabel("00:00:00"); time.setBounds(162, 45, 325, 80); time.setFont(new Font("Arial", 100, 80)); add(time); scramble = new JLabel("Scramble: "); scramble.setBounds(165, 15, 370, 16); add(scramble); //Scrambler scrambler = new Scrambler(scramble); addKeyListener(new timer()); setTitle("Cube Timer"); setLayout(null); setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); setResizable(false); setSize(650, 270); setVisible(true); } int i = 1; public class timer implements KeyListener { @Override public void keyPressed(KeyEvent keyEvent) { if(keyEvent.getKeyCode()==32){ new Stopwatch(i); i++; } @Override public void keyReleased(KeyEvent arg0) { if (arg0.getKeyCode() == 32) { if(i%2==0){ //new Scrambler(scramble); } } } @Override public void keyTyped(KeyEvent arg0) { // TODO Auto-generated method stub } }} </code></pre> <p>Thanks in advance.</p>

33874881	0	 <p>I don't know why you want to keep the unidirectional relation here, because making it bidirectional would make your life much easier.</p> <p>First, <code>CascadeType.ALL</code> on the parent mapping in your example means that if you delete the subfolder, its parent will be deleted also. And this will propagate all the way up to the root folder which is probably not what you want.</p> <p>With bidirectonal mapping it would look like this</p> <pre><code>@ManyToOne @JoinColumn(name = "parent_folder_id") protected Folder parentFolder; @OneToMany(mappedBy = "parentFolder", cascade = {CascadeType.ALL}) protected Set&lt;Folder&gt; children; </code></pre> <p>Without this, you should implement the cascade yourself.

29263645	0	MS Access shared on SharePoint with multiple users and linked tables <p>I have an Access Database (2010) that uses a linked table from a SharePoint (2013) list of names. It does not edit the information on the SharePoint list, but rather pulls the names from SP to populate the name field in the new records in Access. The user then can add in the additional information stored in the Access DB (in this case, it is somewhat of a "report card" form that allows the teacher to input student's grades).</p> <p>This DB is stored on a SharePoint site. When teachers try to use it, they are prompted to save the DB locally and then "Save to SharePoint" when they are done. The problem is that if two teachers are using it at the same time and one saves to SP after the other, the latter teacher will overwrite all the changes that the former teacher made.</p> <p>I've done some research and it seems that "splitting" the Access DB might work to allow teachers to simultaneously edit (only a maximum of 6 users will be editing at the same time). But I have not tried this method before. Will splitting into front-end and back-end affect the linked table of names that is taken from a SharePoint list? What is the best way to allow simultaneous edits?</p>

32924740	0	Found this strange behaviour of Handlers in android <p>I just wrote a code which adds several views, each using a handler. These are added using a for-loop. These add just correctly. Then I tried to add a button AFTER the for loop without using handler. This time the button was shown on the top of the layout i.e BEFORE the items added in for loop. This does not happen if I add the button using handler.</p> <p>So, if I use the following code with a handler after the loop then the button is added on the bottom of the layout:</p> <pre><code> private void fillFeedWithData(final List&lt;ParseObject&gt; feedObjectList) { LayoutInflater inflaterOfFeedItem = (LayoutInflater) getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE); for (int i = 0; i &lt; feedObjectList.size(); i++) { final String jokeTitle = feedObjectList.get(i).getString("content"); final View cvFeedItem = inflaterOfFeedItem.inflate(R.layout.feed_item_theme_card, null); final TextView tvJoke = (TextView) cvFeedItem.findViewById(R.id.tvFeedJoke); Handler h2 = new Handler(); Runnable update2 = new Runnable() { public void run() { tvJoke.setText(jokeTitle); llFragmentFeedParent.addView(cvFeedItem); // llFragmentFeedParent is acquired in OnCreate() method } }; h2.post(update2); } final Button bNext = new Button(this); bNext.setText("Next &gt;"); bNext.setLayoutParams(new ViewGroup.LayoutParams(ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT)); Handler h3 = new Handler(); Runnable update3 = new Runnable() { public void run() { llFragmentFeedParent.addView(bNext); } }; h3.post(update3); } </code></pre> <p>If I used the following code after the loop then the button is added on the top of the layout:</p> <pre><code> Button bNext = new Button(this); bNext.setText("Next &gt;"); bNext.setLayoutParams(new ViewGroup.LayoutParams(ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT)); llFragmentFeedParent.addView(bNext); </code></pre> <p>So now my app is working as intended with the handler but I am concerned as to why this was happening. I think the handlers are mixing up the timings/sequence of execution? If I keep using the logic, is it possible that the button might, in a slow mobile phone, appear on top or even in between the items added in the loop?</p>

9780858	0	Understanding the MVC design pattern in Cocoa Touch <p>Usually I just put together an app in any random way, as long as it works, but this means I don't pay any attention to any design patterns. My application currently makes extensive use of global variables (I carry an instance of my <code>AppDelegate</code> in every view controller to access properties I declared in my <code>AppDelegate.h</code>). Although it does what I want it to do, I've read this is not a good design practice. </p> <p>So I want to start making my code "legit". However, I can't imagine my app right now without global variables. They are so important to the well-being of the app, but this must mean I'm doing something wrong, right? I just can't imagine how else I'd do some things. Take for example this:</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DlH1e.png" alt="enter image description here"></p> <p>You have two view controllers here, a <code>SideViewController</code> and a <code>MainViewController</code>. Using global variables, such as say if the entire application had one shared instance of <code>SideViewController</code> and <code>MainViewController</code> (<code>appDelegate.sideViewController</code> and <code>appDelegate.mainViewController</code>), I can easily communicate between the two view controllers, so that if I press "News Feed" in my <code>SideViewController</code>, I can tell my <code>MainViewController</code> to reload it's view. </p> <p>I can't imagine, however, how this would be done if these were not global variables? If an event occurs in my <code>SideViewController</code>, how would I notify my <code>MainViewController</code>, in a way that is in accordance with design standards?</p>

26956433	1	Python - non-English characters don't work in one case <p>Despite the fact I tried to find a solution to my problem both on english and my native-language sites I was unable to find a solution. I'm querying an online dictionary to get translated words, however non-English characters are displayed as e.g. <code>x86</code> or <code>x84</code>. However, if I just do <code>print(the_same_non-english_character)</code> the letter is displayed in a proper form. I use Python 3.3.2 and the HTML source of the site I extract the words from has <code>charset=UTF-8</code> set. Morever, if I use e.g. <code>replace("x86", "non-english_character")</code>, I don't get anything replaced, but replacing of normal characters works.</p>
17011677	0	 <p>I think you're going to have to handle the quotes after you get the token back because in <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html#next%28java.util.regex.Pattern%29" rel="nofollow">the <code>Scanner#next(String)</code> method</a>, the regex is used to <em>test</em> the next token, not to <em>determine</em> the next token.</p> <p>So, rather than getting the tokenizer to return <code>x</code>, you're going to have to expect the tokenizer to return <code>'x',</code>, and then make that output work. Fortunately, this isn't hard. A quick and dirty way to do that would look like this:</p> <pre><code>String quotedToken=scanner.next(); quotedToken = quotedToken.replace('\'', ' '); quotedToken = quotedToken.replace(',', ' '); quotedToken = quotedToken.trim(); </code></pre> <p>It's probably also worth noting that you can get the <code>Scanner</code> to handle your commas for you if you get a little clever with your delimiter:</p> <pre><code>`scanner.useDelimiter(",?\\s+");` </code></pre>

15120243	0	 <p>Easiest example I can think of would be a method that sends some content to a JMS server. If you are in the context of a transaction, you want the message to be coupled to the transaction scope. But if there isn't already a transaction running, why bother calling the transaction server also and starting one just to do a one-off message?</p> <p>Remember these can be declared on an API as well as an implementation. So even if there isn't much difference for your use case between putting it there and putting nothing there, it still adds value for an API author to specify what operations are able to be included in a transaction, as opposed to operations that perhaps call an external system that does not participate in transactions.</p> <p>This is of course in a JTA context. The feature doesn't really have much practical use in a system where transactions are limited to resource-local physical database transactions.</p>

34677900	0	 <p>That's because <code>getPerson()</code> returns nothing. You are missing a <code>return</code> keyword. </p> <p>Correct structure is:</p> <pre><code>getPerson() { return addressService.get() .then(...) .then(...); } </code></pre> <hr> <p>Side note: There are also several other typos/minor errors to fix:</p> <pre><code>class PersonService { getPerson() { return addressService.get().then(({address}) =&gt; { // &lt;== Added return at beginning of line return `http://localhost/${address}`; // &lt;== Use ` (backtick), not ', for template strings }).then(url =&gt; { // &lt;== Fixed typo return new es6Promise.Promise(function(resolve, reject) { ApiUtils.get(url, {}, {}, { success: resolve, error: reject }); }); }); // &lt;== Fixed typo } } </code></pre>
8394380	0	 <p>If the parent has <code>display:none;</code> then you'll need to show it before trying to slideUp the child. You can do this with the <code>show</code> function.</p> <pre><code>$(divToSlide).parent().show(); $(divToSlide).slideUp(); </code></pre> <p>Per the comment, you could alternatively, you could just set the display property to 'block'</p> <pre><code>$(divToSlide).parent().css("display", "block"); $(divToSlide).slideUp(); </code></pre>
26379546	0	 <p>That you have a third action like this</p> <pre><code> public string Index(int id) { return "int"; } </code></pre> <p>would explain this behaviour</p> <p>of course you don't need the parameterless action either, that's just a special case of the message one, where message is empty</p>
34790328	0	 <p>You don't need to do the roundtrip to DatetimeIndex, as these methods are avaliable for a Series (column) as well through the <code>dt</code> accessor:</p> <pre><code>aht['call_start'] = aht['start'].dt.tz_localize('US/Eastern').dt.tz_convert('US/Central') </code></pre> <p>And the same for <code>end</code>.<br> To remove the timezone information but keep it in the local time, you do another <code>.dt.tz_localize(None)</code> afterwards (see this question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/34687479/653364">http://stackoverflow.com/a/34687479/653364</a>)</p>

15723806	0	 <p>Basic mechanics for this is very simple. Just toggle a class on list container. In CSS set a set of rules for items that are descendent of that class to change floats or columns or css table properties . Also use that main list class to determine what you want displayed within the items, or how you want them displayed</p> <p>Once class is removed they go back to block elements and default css </p> <p>Simple example:</p> <p>HTML:</p> <pre><code>&lt;ul id="itemList"&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;h3 class="title"&gt;Item # 1&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="details"&gt;Detals # 1&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; </code></pre> <p>CSS:</p> <pre><code>.grid li{ float:left; width:30%;margin-right:5px} .grid .details{display:none} </code></pre> <p>JS:</p> <pre><code>$('button').click(function(){ var txt=$(this).text(); txt= txt=='Grid view'? 'List view' : 'Grid view'; $(this).text( txt); $('#itemList').toggleClass('grid') }); </code></pre> <p>DEMO: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/kzDNe/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/kzDNe/</a></p>

6262010	0	 <p>Okay, this answer is SQL Server specific, but should be adaptable to other RDBMSs, with a little work. So far as I see, we have the following constraints:</p> <ul> <li>An invoice may be associated with 0 or 1 Work Orders</li> <li>A Work Order must be associated with an invoice or an ABC or a DEF</li> </ul> <p>I'd design the WorkOrder table as follows:</p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE WorkOrder ( WorkOrderID int IDENTITY(1,1) not null, /* Other Columns */ InvoiceID int null, ABCID int null, DEFID int null, /* Etc for other possible links */ constraint PK_WorkOrder PRIMARY KEY (WorkOrderID), constraint FK_WorkOrder_Invoices FOREIGN KEY (InvoiceID) references Invoice (InvoiceID), constraint FK_WorkOrder_ABC FOREIGN KEY (ABCID) references ABC (ABCID), /* Etc for other FKs */ constraint CK_WorkOrders_SingleFK CHECK ( CASE WHEN InvoiceID is null THEN 0 ELSE 1 END + CASE WHEN ABCID is null THEN 0 ELSE 1 END + CASE WHEN DEFID is null THEN 0 ELSE 1 END /* + other FK columns */ = 1 ) ) </code></pre> <p>So, basically, this table is constrained to only FK to one other table, no matter how many PKs are defined. If necessary, a computed column could tell you the "Type" of item that this is linked to, based on which FK column is non-null, or the type and a single int column could be real columns, and InvoiceID, ABCID, etc could be computed columns.</p> <p>The final thing to ensure is that an invoice only has 0 or 1 Work Orders. If your RDMBS ignores nulls in unique constraints, this is as simple as applying such a constraint to each FK column. For SQL Server, you need to use a filtered index (>=2008) or an indexed view (&lt;=2005). I'll just show the filtered index:</p> <pre><code>CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IX_WorkItems_UniqueInvoices on WorkItem (InvoiceID) where (InvoiceID is not null) </code></pre> <hr> <p>Another way to deal with keeping WorkOrders straight is to include a WorkOrder type column in WorkOrder (e.g. 'Invoice','ABC','DEF'), including a computed or column constrained by check constraint to contain the matching value in the link table, and introduce a second foreign key:</p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE WorkOrder ( WorkOrderID int IDENTITY(1,1) not null, Type varchar(10) not null, constraint PK_WorkOrder PRIMARY KEY (WorkOrderID), constraint UQ_WorkOrder_TypeCheck UNIQUE (WorkOrderID,Type), constraint CK_WorkOrder_Types CHECK (Type in ('INVOICE','ABC','DEF')) ) CREATE TABLE Invoice_WorkOrder ( InvoiceID int not null, WorkOrderID int not null, Type varchar(10) not null default 'INVOICE', constraint PK_Invoice_WorkOrder PRIMARY KEY (InvoiceID), constraint UQ_Invoice_WorkOrder_OrderIDs UNIQUE (WorkOrderID), constraint FK_Invoice_WorkOrder_Invoice FOREIGN KEY (InvoiceID) references Invoice (InvoiceID), constraint FK_Invoice_WorkOrder_WorkOrder FOREIGN KEY (WorkOrderID) references WorkOrder (WorkOrderID), constraint FK_Invoice_WorkOrder_TypeCheck FOREIGN KEY (WorkOrderID,Type) references WorkOrder (WorkOrderID,Type), constraint CK_Invoice_WorkOrder_Type CHECK (Type = 'INVOICE') ) </code></pre> <p>The only disadvantage to this model, although closer to your original proposal, is that you can have a work order that isn't actually linked to any other item (although it claims to be for an e.g INVOICE).</p>

If not, I am sorry.</p> <p>Still, I think that you can easily achieve what you want with the <code>&lt;&lt;-</code> operator. It will impact your performance, though.</p> <pre><code># Let's assume that your loop output is computed by this function : &gt; do.some.stuff &lt;- function(p) { + p + } # If we want to save the last output… &gt; ret &lt;- sapply(1:100000,function(x) { + to.save &lt;&lt;- do.some.stuff(x) + to.save + }) &gt; to.save [1] 100000 # If we want to save all the computed outputs… &gt; to.save &lt;- vector() &gt; ret &lt;- sapply(1:100000,function(x) { + ret &lt;- do.some.stuff(x) + to.save &lt;&lt;- c(to.save, ret) + ret + }) ^C # &lt;-- manual interruption &gt; str(to.save) int [1:21753] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... # Example for dplyr and do(): library(dplyr) system.time({ to.save &lt;- vector() final.ret &lt;- sample_n(iris,10e4,replace=T) %&gt;% rowwise %&gt;% do(w_mean={ ret &lt;- round(.$Sepal.Width,digits=1) to.save &lt;&lt;- c(placeholder,out) ret }) }) # Commenting out the assignment saves about 80 seconds for me. </code></pre> <p>The impact on the performance is quite important, though.

The action associated with these menu items is a class I created (<em>CopyAction</em>) which extends <em>org.eclipse.jface.action.Action</em>.</p> <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>public class CopyAction extends Action { private String text; private String toolTipText; private boolean enabled; private ImageDescriptor imageDescriptor; ... public CopyAction() { text = "Copy"; toolTipText = "Copy Action"; enabled = false; imageDescriptor = ...; } ... @Override public void setEnabled(boolean enabled) { this.enabled = enabled; } @Override public boolean isEnabled() { return enabled; } ... } </code></pre> <p>Note that by default my action is disabled (enabled = false).</p> <p>In my plug-in main view class I create and add the copy action to each of the menus:</p> <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>public class MyDebugView extends AbstractDebugView { CopyAction copyAction; ... @Override protected Viewer createViewer(Composite parent) { // do some stuff to create the viewer content createActions(); fillLocalPullDown(); ... } @Override protected void createActions() { copyAction = new CopyAction(); } private void fillLocalPullDown() { IActionBars bars = getViewSite().getActionBars(); bars.getMenuManager().add(copyAction); } @Override protected void fillContextMenu(IMenuManager manager) { manager.add(copyAction); } @Override protected void configureToolBar(IToolBarManager manager) { manager.add(copyAction)); } } </code></pre> <p>Everything works great up to this point. When I test my plug-in I can see the context menu, the toolbar menu, and the pull-down menu.</p> <p>All the menu items are disabled, as I would expect since the constructor for <em>CopyAction</em> sets enabled = false;</p> <p>What I want to do is enable the menu items when a selection has changed in my plug-in view (which happens to be a <em>TreeViewer</em>). In the callback for the tree selection I do the following:</p> <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>private class MySelectionChangedListener implements ISelectionChangedListener { public void selectionChanged(SelectionChangedEvent event) { // determine if the copy action should be enabled ... copyAction.setEnabled(true) } } </code></pre> <p>The issue I am running into is that even though I set enabled to true on <em>copyAction</em> the menu items do not become enabled.</p> <p>My suspicion as to what's happening is even though I set the enabled property to true nothing happens because the menu(s) need to be notified that the property has changed. Is there some method I have to call to <em>force</em> the menu managers to update themselves thereby checking the enabled property of the copy action?</p> <p>====</p> <p>I have been thinking about the way I have been coding my plug-in and researching the internet on how to add/enable/disable menu items to an Eclipse plug-in. Nearly all of the examples I have seen use <em>plugin.xml</em> to add the menu contributions instead of doing it programatically. (Most also use commands, not actions.) I have also seen where you can enable/disable/hide/show menus using property testers also configured in <em>plugin.xml</em>.</p> <p>Should I just drop the way I am doing things now and do it using the plugin descriptor and property testers? I hate to throw away all the work I have done up to this point but it's more important for me to do it right rather than fuss over time spent.</p>

4046286	0	 <p>One technique that's common (especially in older editors) is called a split buffer. Basically, you "break" the text into everything before the cursor and everything after the cursor. Everything before goes at the beginning of the buffer. Everything after goes at the end of the buffer.</p> <p>When the user types in text, it goes into the empty space in between without moving any data. When the user moves the cursor, you move the appropriate amount of text from one side of the "break" to the other. Typically there's a lot of moving around a single area, so you're usually only moving small amounts of text at a time. The biggest exception is if you have a "go to line xxx" kind of capability.</p> <p>Charles Crowley has written a much more complete <a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~crowley/papers/sds/sds.html">discussion of the topic</a>. You might also want to look at <a href="http://www.finseth.com/craft/index.html">The Craft of Text Editing</a>, which covers split buffers (and other possibilities) in much greater depth.</p>

13802299	0	 <p>Here's one way using <code>GNU awk</code>. Run like:</p> <pre><code>awk -f script.awk file1 file2 </code></pre> <p>Contents of <code>script.awk</code>:</p> <pre><code>BEGIN { FS="[ =:,]" } FNR==NR { a[$1]=$0 next } $2 in a { split(a[$2],b) for (i=3;i&lt;=NF-1;i+=2) { for (j=2;j&lt;=length(b)-1;j+=2) { if ($(i+1) == b[j]) { line = (line ? line "," : "") $i ":" b[j+1] } } } print $1 "=" line line = "" } </code></pre> <p>Results:</p> <pre><code>Tom=John:5,Mike:5 </code></pre> <p>Alternatively, here's the one-liner:</p> <pre><code>awk -F "[ =:,]" 'FNR==NR { a[$1]=$0; next } $2 in a { split(a[$2],b); for (i=3;i&lt;=NF-1;i+=2) for (j=2;j&lt;=length(b)-1;j+=2) if ($(i+1) == b[j]) line = (line ? line "," : "") $i ":" b[j+1]; print $1 "=" line; line = "" }' file1 file2 </code></pre> <p>Explanation:</p> <blockquote> <p>Change awk's field separator to a either a space, equals, colon or comma.</p> <p>'FNR==NR { ... }' is only true for the first file in the arguments list.</p> <p>So when processing file1, awk will add column '1' to an array and we assign the whole line as a value to this array element.</p> <p>'next' will simply skip processing the rest of the script, and read the next line of input.</p> <p>When awk has finished reading the input in file1, it will continue reading file2. However, this also resets 'FNR' to '1', so awk will skip processing the 'FNR==NR' block for file2 because it is not longer true.</p> <p>So for file2: if column '2' can be found in the array mentioned above:</p> <blockquote> <p>Split the value of the array element into another array. This essentially splits up the whole line in file1.</p> <p>Now create two loops.</p> <blockquote> <p>The first will loop through all the names in file2</p> <p>And the second will loop through all the values in the (second) array (this essentially loops over all the fields in file1).</p> </blockquote> <p>Now when a value succeeding a name in file2 is equal to one of the key numbers in file1, create a line construct that looks like: 'name:number_following_key_number_from_file1'.</p> <p>When more names and values are found during the loops, the quaternary construct '( ... ? ... : ...)' adds these elements onto the end of the line. It's like an if statement; if there's already a line, add a comma onto the end of it, else don't do anything.</p> <p>When all the loops are complete, print out column '1' and the line. Then empty the line variable so that it can be used again.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>HTH. Goodluck.</p>

27336085	0	jar built with jwrapper doesn't work <p>jwrapper manipulates application jars somehow, and is resulting in a non-functioning jar: at runtime it throws a "MyClass cannot be cast to MyClass" type error. I believe this is caused by re-evaluating code that creates a class loader, leading to multiple instances of class MyClass being loaded.</p> <p>The jwrapper docs don't describe the changes made to the jar, except for the use of pack200. I've tested pack200 in isolation, and it does not cause this problem.</p> <p>I've also tested the jar built by jwrapper without using the wrapper executable, by passing it to "java -jar". So it's not jvm transmuting, or anything else that the wrapper is doing: the jar itself is broken.</p> <p>UPDATE:</p> <p>jwrapper allows skipping pack200, but then the install file is huge. Since pack200 works when run standalone, I could work around this if there were some way to tell jwrapper that the file is already packed. Using &lt;Pack200Exceptions&gt; doesn't help, because then it doesn't know the file is packed.</p>

1753357	0	Per-file enabling of scope guards <p>Here's a little problem I've been thinking about for a while now that I have not found a solution for yet.</p> <p>So, to start with, I have this function guard that I use for debugging purpose:</p> <pre><code>class FuncGuard { public: FuncGuard(const TCHAR* funcsig, const TCHAR* funcname, const TCHAR* file, int line); ~FuncGuard(); // ... }; #ifdef _DEBUG #define func_guard() FuncGuard __func_guard__( TEXT(__FUNCSIG__), TEXT(__FUNCTION__), TEXT(__FILE__), __LINE__) #else #define func_guard() void(0) #endif </code></pre> <p>The guard is intended to help trace the path the code takes at runtime by printing some information to the debug console. It is intended to be used such as:</p> <pre><code>void TestGuardFuncWithCommentOne() { func_guard(); } void TestGuardFuncWithCommentTwo() { func_guard(); // ... TestGuardFuncWithCommentOne(); } </code></pre> <p>And it gives this as a result:</p> <pre> ..\tests\testDebug.cpp(121): Entering[ void __cdecl TestGuardFuncWithCommentTwo(void) ] ..\tests\testDebug.cpp(114): Entering[ void __cdecl TestGuardFuncWithCommentOne(void) ] Leaving[ TestGuardFuncWithCommentOne ] Leaving[ TestGuardFuncWithCommentTwo ] </pre> <p>Now, one thing that I quickly realized is that it's a pain to add and remove the guards from the function calls. It's also unthinkable to leave them there permanently as they are because it drains CPU cycles for no good reasons and it can quickly bring the app to a crawl. Also, even if there were no impacts on the performances of the app in debug, there would soon be a flood of information in the debug console that would render the use of this debug tool useless.</p> <p>So, I thought it could be a good idea to enable and disable them on a per-file basis.</p> <p>The idea would be to have all the function guards disabled by default, but they could be enabled automagically in a whole file simply by adding a line such as</p> <pre><code>EnableFuncGuards(); </code></pre> <p>at the top of the file.</p> <p>I've thought about many a solutions for this. I won't go into details here since my question is already long enough, but let just say that I've tried more than a few trick involving macros that all failed, and one involving explicit implementation of templates but so far, none of them can get me the actual result I'm looking for.</p> <p>Another restricting factor to note: The header in which the function guard mechanism is currently implemented is included through a precompiled header. I know it complicates things, but if someone could come up with a solution that could work in this situation, that would be awesome. If not, well, I certainly can extract that header fro the precompiled header.</p> <p>Thanks a bunch in advance!</p>

Any class that is Comparable can be used with it.</p> <pre><code>class PriorityQueue&lt;E extends Comparable&lt;E&gt;&gt; { List&lt;E&gt; heap = new ArrayList&lt;E&gt;(); Map&lt;E, Integer&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;E, Integer&gt;(); void insert(E e) { heap.add(e); map.put(e, heap.size() - 1); bubbleUp(heap.size() - 1); } E deleteMax() { if(heap.size() == 0) return null; E result = heap.remove(0); map.remove(result); heapify(0); return result; } E getMin() { if(heap.size() == 0) return null; return heap.get(0); } void update(E oldObject, E newObject) { int index = map.get(oldObject); heap.set(index, newObject); bubbleUp(index); } private void bubbleUp(int cur) { while(cur &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; heap.get(parent(cur)).compareTo(heap.get(cur)) &lt; 0) { swap(cur, parent(cur)); cur = parent(cur); } } private void swap(int i, int j) { map.put(heap.get(i), map.get(heap.get(j))); map.put(heap.get(j), map.get(heap.get(i))); E temp = heap.get(i); heap.set(i, heap.get(j)); heap.set(j, temp); } private void heapify(int index) { if(left(index) &gt;= heap.size()) return; int bigIndex = index; if(heap.get(bigIndex).compareTo(heap.get(left(index))) &lt; 0) bigIndex = left(index); if(right(index) &lt; heap.size() &amp;&amp; heap.get(bigIndex).compareTo(heap.get(right(index))) &lt; 0) bigIndex = right(index); if(bigIndex != index) { swap(bigIndex, index); heapify(bigIndex); } } private int parent(int i) { return (i - 1) / 2; } private int left(int i) { return 2*i + 1; } private int right(int i) { return 2*i + 2; } } </code></pre> <p>Here while updating, I am only increasing the priority (for my implementation) and it is using MaxHeap, so I am doing bubbleUp. One may need to heapify based on requirement.</p>

It's your responsibility to ensure that the memory you placed the object into isn't aliased by anything it shouldn't be.</p> <p>In this case, you cannot assume that <code>uint8_t</code> is an alias for <code>char</code> and therefore has the special aliasing rules applied. In addition, it would be fairly pointless to use an array of <code>uint8_t</code> rather than <code>char</code> because <code>sizeof()</code> is in terms of <code>char</code>, not <code>uint8_t</code>. You'd have to compute the size yourself.</p> <p>In addition, <code>reinterpret_cast</code>'s effect is entirely implementation-defined, so the code certainly does not have a well-defined meaning.</p> <p>To implement low-level unpleasant memory hacks, the original memory needs to be only aliased by <code>char*</code>, <code>void*</code>, and <code>T*</code>, where <code>T</code> is the final destination type- in this case <code>int</code>, plus whatever else you can get from a <code>T*</code>, such as if <code>T</code> is a derived class and you convert that derived class pointer to a pointer to base.

String parameter that is a logical name used to select the &gt;GGSN or the external packet data network. If the value is empty (“”) or omitted, &gt;3GPP TS 27.007 AT COMMANDS then the subscription value is requested. &gt;... </code></pre> <p>What effect would that be if I leave the APN field blank? It seems I can connect to the cell network while leaving the APN field blank. I tried several SIM cards and they all seem to work without specifying the APN field. However, I'd like to know for sure that what I do is appropriate. Because I have very limited UI capability (no real keypad on the device that the modem is attached to), it is highly desirable if an end user does not have to enter any APN information.</p>

That way you can grab the <code>.newreply</code> to show based on a shared unique <code>id</code> which would be agnostic regarding the positioning of the <code>HTML</code> layout.</p> <p>E.g.</p> <pre><code>&lt;div class="roar" rel="msg0"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt; ... &lt;button class="btn-reply" rel="msg0"&gt;&lt;/button&gt; ... &lt;div class="newreply" rel="msg0"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt; ... </code></pre> <p>Then your jQuery becomes:</p> <pre><code>$('.btn-reply').click(function(){ var id = $(this).attr('rel'); var selector = '.newreply[rel=' + id + ']'; $(selector).toggleClass('show'); return false; }); </code></pre>
26726595	0	 <p>The part you are asking about is an anonymous method that uses a lambda expression. It is commonly used in callbacks.</p> <p>When you write this</p> <pre><code>(machine, error) =&gt; { SelectedMachine = new MachineViewModel(machine); } </code></pre> <p>you are making a function that has no name (and therefore cannot be reused by name, like a regular method). It is very convenient in situations when you need to produce a piece of callable code that needs to be used only once, e.g. in callbacks.</p> <p>Note that the method does not have to be anonymous: you could make an equivalent named method. However, an since the anonymous method is built in the context of the method where it is used, the variables from the context are available to it. Your anonymous method assigns <code>SelectedMachine</code>, which is probably a property of your class. In the same way, anonymous methods can access local variables as well, which is a very powerful mechanism of combining together a state and a piece of code that operates on it.</p>

30066110	0	 <p>"Hash table" is just a fancier way of saying "ordinary Javascript object". What the instructor means by "handle to its definition" is just another way of saying "the function that acts as a constructor for the class".</p> <p>Ultimately, what he means by the statement you mentioned:</p> <blockquote> <p>each overloaded entity definition will update a hash table with a pointer to its class definition</p> </blockquote> <p>is the following:</p> <ul> <li>All "subclasses" of Entity will register their constructor function in a single shared hashmap/object using the key which is the <code>type</code> value.</li> <li>This allows you to get the constructor function (in other words, the function to call <code>new</code> on, which will return an instance of that entity) for any type by accessing <code>gGameEngine.factory[type]</code>.</li> </ul> <p>This is nice, because whenever a programmer adds a new type of entity, so long as they remember to add a new entry to that <code>gGameEngine.factory</code> object with the correct key, then that object will contain everything you need to construct any type of supported object.</p> <p>So the code that iterates over the JSON structure generated by the level editor can create an instance of any type the same way, using something like:</p> <pre><code>var typeConstructor = gGameEngine.factory(tileSpec.type), instance; if (typeConstructor) { instance = new(typeConstructor)(tileSpec /* or whatever params */); } </code></pre> <p>This is similar to the code visible at around the 1 minute mark of the video you linked to.</p> <p>Make sense now?</p>

The primitive (what I would call <em>scalar</em>) data types are all numbers and are completely defined by the language; you cannot add to them (though you can rename them using <code>typedef</code>.

16182526	0	Android multiline edittext not increasing its height as the user types <p>So the layout is quite simple. A <code>ListView</code> occupying most of the screen, and a <code>RelativeLayout</code> at the bottom containing the <code>EditText</code> and a <code>Button</code> to the right. Everything looks great, but the problem is that as the user types and enters new lines, the <code>EditText</code> is not increasing its height just enough so that the user can see all the text types without scrolling. You would think that using <code>WRAP_CONTENT</code> on both the <code>EditText</code> and its parent <code>RelativeLayout</code> would take care of that, but it doesn't for some reason. Any ideas?

14777514	0	 <p>I've been wondering this for a while also; the OpenCV documentation isn't very helpful when it comes to blob detection.</p> <p>Based on the descriptions of <a href="http://www1.adept.com/main/KE/Data/ACE/AdeptSight_User/BlobAnalyzer_Results.html#Intrinsic_Inertia_Results">other blob analyzers</a>, the inertia of a blob is "the inertial resistance of the blob to rotation about its principal axes". It depends on how the mass of the blob (I guess in this case the area) is distributed throughout the blob's shape.</p> <p>There's a lot of mathy stuff involved -- most of which I don't remember how to do -- but the result at the bottom of <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/OWENS/LECT2/node3.html">this page on the properties of binary images</a> sums it up fairly well (blob detection is done by converting the input image to a series of binary images):</p> <blockquote> <p>The ratio <img src="https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=I_%7Bmin%7D%2FI_%7Bmax%7D&amp;chf=bg,s,65432100" alt="I_min/I_max"> gives us some idea of how rounded the object is. This ratio will be 0 for a line and 1 for a circle.</p> </blockquote> <p>So basically, by specifying <code>minInertiaRatio</code> and <code>maxInertiaRatio</code> you can filter the blobs based on how elongated they are. An inertia ratio of 0 will yield elongated blobs (closer to lines) and an inertia ratio of 1 will yield blobs where the area is more concentrated toward the center (closer to circles).</p>

4382442	0	 <p>(Before the longer discussion: it looks like you're typing <code>myButton</code> one line 2, and <code>eventButton</code> on line 3. Make sure these match!)</p> <p>You're correct in thinking that you're creating a new instance of <code>mainViewController</code>. To get at the one you want, You'll either need to pass a reference to <code>mainViewController</code> into the new view controller when you create it, writing a method like:</p> <pre><code>@synthesize mainViewController; -(void) initWithMainVC:(MainViewController *)mainVC { if ((self = [super init])) { self.mainViewController = mainVC; } return self; } </code></pre> <p>to override <code>init</code>, or, if you've got a reference to <code>mainViewController</code> in your App Delegate, you can get it using:</p> <pre><code>MainViewController *mainVC = [(YourAppDelegate *)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate] mainViewController]; </code></pre> <p>Either way you choose, you'll want to read up on object oriented programming and pointers in objective C. When you call <code>alloc</code>, you're manufacturing a new copy of that class. All copies sit in different chunks of memory, so any new one you make (as in your code above) is actually a totally different entity, like two Priuses, or something like that.</p> <p>A pointer is like a nametag that identifies, or points the way, to that block of memory. In my <code>init</code> code example above, we're attaching a new nametag to a <code>mainViewController</code> instance with the same guts. Same thing with the second line -- we make a new pointer (see the star?) tell it it's going to be pointing to a <code>MainViewController</code> instance, and slap that nametag, or pointer, on to an instance.</p> <p>(The second one is a little more complicated, as you're plucking <code>mainViewController</code> from an object called a singleton, or an object that you can get at from anywhere... read more about those and the App Delegate at <a href="http://cocoawithlove.com/2008/11/singletons-appdelegates-and-top-level.html" rel="nofollow">this post</a> from Cocoa with Love.)</p> <p>Anyway, I get nervous expounding on this stuff on Stack!

12084622	0	 <p>"Really only useful" is a little subjective, don't you think? If you're asking about whether it's more important to pre-compile templates used server-side as opposed to client-side, it usually is, simply because a server is going to have to render them potentially several thousand times a second so it's wasteful to have to compile them each time they're rendered.</p> <p>In a client-side app, the main concern is whether there's any user-noticeable slowdown associated with rendering templates. There usually isn't, and if there is, generally only a few (maybe partial templates used to build large list views) are responsible. So in most client-side apps, pre-compiling templates is a form of premature optimization.</p>

It seems to be adding a significant margin to the left of the puzzle table, despite my explicitly setting its left margin to 0.</p> <p>Interestingly enough, the smaller the scale in my webkit transformation, the bigger the margin on the left.

35397885	0	 <p>I encountered this issue as you did. I got an error that's something like "couldn't find package Emacs-24.4". This inspired me to install <code>Emacs-24.4</code> on my Ubuntu, instead of older version <code>24.3</code> which is the newest I can get from <code>apt-get</code>. (A convincing fact is that the newer version <code>24.5</code> provided by <code>Homebrew</code> works well with Purcell's package on my Mac.) </p> <p>Under <code>Emacs 24.4</code>, <code>slime</code> proved to run well with Purcell's <code>.emacs.d/</code>. But it really costs me a lot of time to install <code>Emacs-24.4</code> on my Ubuntu. First, I had to solve the problems of dependencies. Using <code>aptitude</code>, I get rid of the problem which <code>apt-get</code> failed to solve:</p> <pre><code>sudo apt-get install aptitude sudo aptitude install build-essential sudo aptitude build-dep emacs24 </code></pre> <p>When the dependency issue pops out, <code>aptitude</code> will give you some suggestions including downgrading your current packages. I chose solutions of downgrade without leaving over any unsolved dependency problem (select 'no' until you find an acceptable one). During reinstalling build packages, Ubuntu iso cdrom may be required. </p> <p>Then install <code>Emacs 24.4</code>:</p> <pre><code>wget http://open-source-box.org/emacs/emacs-24.4.tar.xz tar xvf emacs-24.4.tar.xz cd emacs-24.4 ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/.local/lib --without-pop --without-kerberos --without-mmdf --without-sound --without-wide-int --without-xpm --without-jpeg --without-tiff --without-gif --without-png --without-rsvg --without-xml2 --without-imagemagick --without-xft --without-libotf --without-m17n-flt --without-xaw3d --without-xim --without-ns --without-gpm --without-dbus --without-gconf --without-gsettings --without-selinux --without-gnutls --without-x make &amp;&amp; make install </code></pre> <p>References: </p> <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/tnarihi/6054dfa7b4ad2564819b" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/tnarihi/6054dfa7b4ad2564819b</a></p> <p><a href="http://linuxg.net/how-to-install-emacs-24-4-on-ubuntu-14-10-ubuntu-14-04-and-derivative-systems/" rel="nofollow">http://linuxg.net/how-to-install-emacs-24-4-on-ubuntu-14-10-ubuntu-14-04-and-derivative-systems/</a></p>

27549500	0	 <p>I think msmq's answer is valid, but you should be a little careful about using the main info.plist this way. Doing that suggests that all your versions of info.plist are almost identical, except for a couple of differences. That's a recipe for divergence, and then hard-to-debug issues when you want to add a new URI handler or background mode or any of the other things that might modify info.plist.</p> <p>Instead, I recommend you take the keys that vary out of the main info.plist. Create another plist (say "Config.plist") to store them. Add a Run Script build phase to copy the correct one over. See the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/DeveloperTools/Reference/XcodeBuildSettingRef/1-Build_Setting_Reference/build_setting_ref.html" rel="nofollow">Build Settings Reference</a> for a list of variables you can substitute. An example script might be:</p> <pre><code>cp ${SOURCE_ROOT}/Resources/Config-${CONFIGURATION}.plist ${UNLOCALIZED_RESOURCES_FOLDER_PATH}/Config.plist </code></pre> <p>Then you can read the file using something like this (based on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/PropertyLists/QuickStartPlist/QuickStartPlist.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000048i-CH4-SW6" rel="nofollow">Read in the Property List</a>):</p> <pre><code>NSString *baseURL; NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"Config" ofType:@"plist"]; NSData *plistXML = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] contentsAtPath:plistPath]; NSString *errorDesc = nil; NSDictionary *dict = (NSDictionary *)[NSPropertyListSerialization propertyListFromData:plistXML mutabilityOption:NSPropertyListImmutable format:NULL errorDescription:&amp;errorDesc]; if (dict != nil) { baseUrl = dict[@"baseURL"]; } else { NSAssert(@"Could not read plist: %@", errorDesc); // FIXME: Return error } </code></pre> <p>There are other solutions of course. I personally generally use the preprocessor for this kind of problem. In my build configuration, I would set <code>GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS</code> to include <code>BaseURL=...</code> for each build configuration and then in some header I would have:</p> <pre><code>#ifndef BaseURL #define BaseURL @"http://default.example.com" #endif </code></pre> <p>The plist way is probably clearer and easier if you have several things to set, especially if they're long or complicated (and definitely if they would need quoting). The preprocessor solution takes less code to process and has fewer failure modes (since the strings are embedded in the binary at compile time rather than read at runtime). But both are good solutions.</p>

32237671	0	 <p>I thought so (the <strong>32 bit</strong> part). You're running into a problem generated by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa384253(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">Registry redirection</a>.</p> <p>In other words (on 64bit <em>Windows</em>), for some registry keys (this one included) there are 2 separate locations: one for 64bit(default and old one) and other for 32bit(a new location). By default a 64bit app automatically uses the 64bit registry location; same thing for 32 bit (of course that can be programmatically modified - at least for 64bit apps). </p> <p>So, in order for 32bit apps that have some registry keys hardcoded to still work on 64bit <em>Windows</em> (remember the key hardcoded in the 32bit app is now 64 bit, and it's <em>invisible</em> to the app, while the <em>real</em> 32bit is someplace else), <em>Microsoft</em> came up with this approach. Same approach applies to paths on the filesystem (<em><strong>System32</strong></em> vs <em><strong>SysWOW64</strong></em> under <em>C:\Windows</em>).</p> <p>Now why does it work from cmdline? Being a 64bit OS, the default <em>cmd</em> is 64 bit (which launches the 64bit <em>reg.exe</em>), so it finds the key. Yes you have 2 <em>cmd</em>s (one under each of the above folders), actually (almost) all the <em>Windows</em> executables and dlls are <em>duplicated</em>.</p> <p>To test, start <em>cmd.exe</em> from <em>C:\Windows\SysWOW64</em>, and run the <em>reg</em> command and it will fail.</p> <p>Finally, to get past this, associate <em>.py</em> files (I noticed that you ran it directly) with a 64bit <em>Python</em> version (you might have to download and install it).</p>

I then used the code below to get the application to save the input data to the database.</p> <pre><code>private void FPAccountNotExist_LinkClicked(object sender, LinkLabelLinkClickedEventArgs e) { //Make forgot password page invisible and create new account page visible ForgotPassword.Visible = false; CreateNewAccount.Visible = true; //Set text content of labels on create new account page CreateNewAccountTitle.Text = "Create New Account"; CNAConfirmLabel.Text = "Confirm Password"; CNAEmailLabel.Text = "Email"; CNAInstruction.Text = "Please fill in the following details."; CNAOpenAccount.Text = "Submit new account"; CNAPasswordLabel.Text = "Password"; CNAUsernameLabel.Text = "Username"; OpenManual.Text = "Start with Manual"; CNAConfirmTextBox.UseSystemPasswordChar = true; CNAPasswordTextBox.UseSystemPasswordChar = true; </code></pre> <p>}</p> <pre><code>private void CNAOpenAccount_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { AccountVariables.ConfirmedPassword = CNAConfirmTextBox.Text; AccountVariables.Email = CNAEmailTextBox.Text; AccountVariables.Password = CNAPasswordTextBox.Text; AccountVariables.Username = CNAUsernameTextBox.Text; //GeneralVariables.ManualOption = OpenManual.Checked; var CreateNewAccountStrings = new List&lt;string&gt; { AccountVariables.ConfirmedPassword, AccountVariables.Password, AccountVariables.Email, AccountVariables.Username }; if (CreateNewAccountStrings.Contains("")) { MessageBox.Show("All textboxes should be filled"); } else { if ((AccountVariables.ConfirmedPassword == AccountVariables.Password) &amp;&amp; (AccountVariables.Password.Length &gt;= 8)) { accountTableTableAdapter.Fill(accountDatabaseDataSet.AccountTable); AccountVariables.defaultAccountRow = AccountVariables.defaultAccountRow + 1; AccountVariables.newAccountTableRow = accountDatabaseDataSet.AccountTable.NewAccountTableRow(); AccountVariables.newAccountTableRow.UserId = AccountVariables.defaultAccountRow; AccountVariables.newAccountTableRow.Username = AccountVariables.Username; AccountVariables.newAccountTableRow.Email = AccountVariables.Email; AccountVariables.newAccountTableRow.Password = AccountVariables.Password; accountDatabaseDataSet.AccountTable.AddAccountTableRow(AccountVariables.newAccountTableRow); accountTableTableAdapter.Update(accountDatabaseDataSet.AccountTable); accountDatabaseDataSet.AccountTable.AcceptChanges(); AccountVariables.AccountDatabaseConnection.Close(); } } } </code></pre> <p>However, when I closed the program after running the application, I looked in the database and saw that the rows had not been saved, even after I have saved it. Please can you help me solve this problem.</p>

Most important: do you need all 50000 rows to be displayed?</p> <p>50000 records are not many records, but it's unusual to show all in a web application since that means you have to generate the HTML for all records and display it in the client's browser(maybe even using <code>ViewState</code>).

4829249	0	 <p>i think i read somewhere that it is more difficult to add table rows to an existing table. it had something to do with some browsers adding a tbody tag for you and other browsers not liking a tr tag that doesn't have a table tag wrapped around it (ie).</p> <p>if possible, you could convert your table to divs (or possibly lis) then i think you could get around this issue. i think jQueryUI's draggable has this limitation, not sure.</p> <p>if moving away from tables is not possible, you can probably hide the row, then instantaneously move the row to position, and create a div that looks just like it and move that around, then after the animation you kill the animation div and show the new row.</p> <p>hth</p>

Instead of 7 INSERT calls to the database per custom post, I end up with 2 making a gynormous difference when attempting to process multiple custom fields while iterating over a large number of posts - in my case now, 20k entries are processed to completion within 15-20min (vs a situation where I would experience a dropout after ~17k posts and a few hrs of processing time)...</p> <p>So the key thing I learned from this whole experience, </p> <p>mind your database calls - they can quickly add up!</p>
29392238	0	 <p>Using HtmlAgilityPack (HAP) and XPath function <code>name()</code> didn't work for me, but replacing <code>name()</code> with <code>local-name()</code> did the trick :</p> <pre><code>//*/@*[starts-with(local-name(), 'on')] </code></pre> <p>However, both <code>SelectSingleNode()</code> and <code>SelectNodes()</code> only able to return <code>HtmlNode</code>(s).

12763310	0	 <p>It seems, that your problem has indeed to do with UTF-8. I analyzed your example pages with firebug, and it revealed, that the html pages contain the <strong>UTF-8 BOM-header</strong>, but the untranslated page contains it twice!</p> <p>These 3 characters ( ï»¿) at the begin of the file are written by your editor, but they won't be displayed. With a HEX-editor you can see the difference, you can also go to the file properties and look at the file size, you will notice that they differ slightly.</p> <p>My recommendation would be, to save the files as UTF-8 <strong>without</strong> BOM-header. Especially the double header makes the IE to switch to the quirks-mode (you can press <code>F12</code> to get the developer tools in IE to see it), and that causes the different rendering. A double BOM-header is wrong in any case.</p> <p>EDIT:</p> <p>Just found a wonderful tool for <a href="http://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/" rel="nofollow">checking utf-8 BOM and header</a> problems.</p>

16197555	0	Keeping std::map balanced when using an object as key <p>I am writing some code where I am storing lots of objects that I want to get back based on set criteria. So to me it made sense to use a map with an object as a key. Where the object would contain the "set criteria".</p> <p>Here is a simplified example of the kind of objects i am dealing with:</p> <pre><code> class key { int x,y,w,h; } class object { ... } std::map&lt;key, object, KeyCompare&gt; m_mapOfObjects; </code></pre> <p>Quite simple, the first thought was to create a compare functions like this:</p> <pre><code> struct KeyCompare { bool operator()(const key &amp;a, const key &amp;b) { return a.x &lt; b.x || a.y &lt; b.y || a.w &lt; b.w || a.h &lt; b.h; } } </code></pre> <p>but then i thought the chances of this returning true are quite high. So I figured this would lead to a very unbalanced tree and therefore slow searching. </p> <p>My main worry is that as I understand it, std::map uses that one function in this way: if( keyCompare(a,b) ) { //left side } else if (keyCompare(b,a)) { //right side } else { //equal } So i can't just use a.x &lt; b.x, because then anything with the same x would be considered equal, which is not what i want. I would not mind it ordering it in this way but its the "equal" bit i just can't seem to solve without making it unbalanced. </p> <p>I figure multiplying them all together is a no no for obvious reasons.</p> <p>So the only solution i could come up with was to create a "UID" base on the info:</p> <pre><code> typedef long unsigned int UIDType; class key { private: UIDType combine(const UIDType a, const UIDType b) { UIDType times = 1; while (times &lt;= b) times *= 10; return (a*times) + b; } void AddToUID(UIDType number) { if(number &lt; m_UID) { m_UID = combine(number, m_UID); } else { m_UID = combine(m_UID, number); } } UIDType UID; public: int x,y,w,h; key() { AddToUID(x); AddToUID(y); AddToUID(w); AddToUID(h); } } struct KeyCompare { bool operator()(const key &amp;a, const key &amp;b) { return a.UID &lt; b.UID; } } </code></pre> <p>But not only does that feel a little hacky, "long unsigned int" isn't big enough to hold the potential numbers. I <em>could</em> put it in a string, but speed is an issue here and I assumed an std::string &lt; is expensive. Overall though the smaller i can make this object the better. </p> <p>I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions for how to do this better. Perhaps i need to use something other then a std::map or perhaps there is another overload. Or perhaps there is something glaringly obvious that i'm missing here. I really feel like i'm over-complicating this, perhaps im really barking up the wrong tree with a map. </p> <p>As i was writing this it occurs to me that divide is another way to get a "unique" number but that could also equal very large numbers</p>
